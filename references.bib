	abstract = {Regions in the medial temporal lobes ({MTL}) have long been implicated in the formation of new memories for events, however, it is unclear whether different {MTL} subregions support different memory processes. Here, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to examine the degree to which two recognition memory processes—recollection and familiarity—were supported by different {MTL} subregions. Results showed that encoding activity in the rhinal cortex selectively predicted familiarity-based recognition, whereas, activity in the hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal cortex selectively predicted recollection. Collectively, these results support the view that different subregions within the {MTL} memory system implement unique encoding processes that differentially support familiarity and recollection.},

	abstract = {The ability to hold multiple objects in memory is fundamental to intelligent behavior, but its neural basis remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that multiple items may be held in memory by oscillatory activity across neuronal populations, but yet there is little direct evidence. Here, we show that neuronal information about two objects held in short-term memory is enhanced at specific phases of underlying oscillatory population activity. We recorded neuronal activity from the prefrontal cortices of monkeys remembering two visual objects over a brief interval. We found that during this memory interval prefrontal population activity was rhythmically synchronized at frequencies around 32 and 3 Hz and that spikes carried the most information about the memorized objects at specific phases. Further, according to their order of presentation, optimal encoding of the first presented object was significantly earlier in the 32 Hz cycle than that for the second object. Our results suggest that oscillatory neuronal synchronization mediates a phase-dependent coding of memorized objects in the prefrontal cortex. Encoding at distinct phases may play a role for disambiguating information about multiple objects in short-term memory.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a model for the short-term memory ({STM}) of unique lists of known items, as, for instance, a phone number. We show that the ability to accurately store such lists in {STM} depends strongly on interaction with the preexisting long-term memory ({LTM}) for individual items (e.g., digits). We have examined this interaction in computer simulations of a network based on physiologically realistic membrane conductances, synaptic plasticity processes, and brain oscillations. In the model, seven {STMs} can be kept active, each in a different gamma-frequency subcycle of a theta-frequency oscillation. Each {STM} is maintained and timed by an activity-dependent ramping process. {LTM} is stored by the strength of synapses in recurrent collaterals. The presence of preexisting {LTM} for an item greatly enhances the ability of the network to store an item in {STM}. Without {LTM}, the precise timing required to keep cells firing within a given gamma subcycle cannot be maintained and {STM} is gradually degraded. With {LTM}, timing errors can be corrected and the accuracy and order of items is maintained. This attractor property of {STM} storage is remarkable because it occurs even though there is no {LTM} that identifies which items are on the list or their order. Multiple known items can be stored in {STM}, even though their representation is overlapping. However, multiple, identical memories cannot be stored in {STM}, consistent with the psychophysical demonstration of repetition blindness. Our results indicate that meaningful computation (memory completion) can occur in the millisecond range during an individual gamma cycle.},

	abstract = {Isolating the short-term storage component of working memory ({WM}) from the myriad of associated executive processes has been an enduring challenge. Recent efforts have identified patterns of activity in visual regions that contain information about items being held in {WM}. However, it remains unclear (1) whether these representations withstand intervening sensory input and (2) how communication between multimodal association cortex and the unimodal perceptual regions supporting {WM} representations is involved in {WM} storage. We present evidence that the features of a face held in {WM} are stored within face-processing regions, that these representations persist across subsequent sensory input, and that information about the match between sensory input and a memory representation is relayed forward from perceptual to prefrontal regions. Participants were presented with a series of probe faces and indicated whether each probe matched a target face held in {WM}. We parametrically varied the feature similarity between the probe and target faces. Activity within face-processing regions scaled linearly with the degree of feature similarity between the probe face and the features of the target face, suggesting that the features of the target face were stored in these regions. Furthermore, directed connectivity measures revealed that the direction of information flow that was optimal for performance was from sensory regions that stored the features of the target face to dorsal prefrontal regions, supporting the notion that sensory input is compared to representations stored within perceptual regions and is subsequently relayed forward. Together, these findings indicate that {WM} storage operations are carried out within perceptual cortex.},

We found that temporal correlation between place cell pairs was stronger than predicted by a pacemaker drive of independent neurons, indicating a critical role for synaptic interactions and precise timing within and across cell assemblies in place sequence representation. {CA}1 and {CA}3 ensembles, identifying spatial locations, were active preferentially on opposite phases of theta cycles.

In several studies participants watched movie clips that presented objects in the context of goal-directed activities. Five seconds after an object was presented, the clip paused for a recognition test. Performance on the recognition test depended on the occurrence of perceptual event boundaries. Objects that were present when an event boundary occurred were better recognized than other objects, suggesting that event boundaries structure the contents of memory. This effect was strongest when an object’s type was tested, but was also observed for objects’ perceptual features. Memory also depended on whether an event boundary occurred between presentation and test; this variable produced complex interactive effects that suggested that the contents of memory are updated at event boundaries. These data indicate that perceptual event boundaries have immediate consequences for what, when, and how easily information can be remembered.},

Prior to the study phase, participants performed a localizer task, in which the fusiform face area ({FFA}) was identified. We compared brain activation patterns for remember and know responses given to words studied with faces as compared to scrambled faces. Though behaviourally participants showed no difference in memory performance depending on encoding trial type, both a group- and individual-based region-of-interest analysis showed increased activation in the functionally-defined {FFA} for remember responses given to words studied with faces compared to scrambled faces. A regression analysis additionally showed that activation in the right fusiform gyrus increased as the relative recollection benefit for words studied with meaningful (face) compared to non-meaningful (scrambled face) context information increased. Results suggest that context-specific brain regions implicated during encoding are recruited during retrieval, and that the degree to which participants activate context-specific brain regions during retrieval is related to a behavioural benefit in later recollection for target information presented alone.},

The events surrounding a target event, and the thoughts they evoke, may be considered to represent a context for the target event, helping to distinguish that event from similar events experienced at different times. The ability to reinstate this contextual information during memory search has been considered a hallmark of episodic, or event-based, memory. We sought to determine whether context reinstatement may be observed in electrical signals recorded from the human brain during episodic recall. Analyzing electrocorticographic recordings taken as 69 neurosurgical patients studied and recalled lists of words, we uncovered a neural signature of context reinstatement. Upon recalling a studied item, we found that the recorded patterns of brain activity were not only similar to the patterns observed when the item was studied, but were also similar to the patterns observed during study of neighboring list items, with similarity decreasing reliably with positional distance. The degree to which individual patients displayed this neural signature of context reinstatement was correlated with their tendency to recall neighboring list items successively. These effects were particularly strong in temporal lobe recordings. Our findings show that recalling a past event evokes a neural signature of the temporal context in which the event occurred, thus pointing to a neural basis for episodic memory.},

For paired associates, it is assumed that Ss store only labeled n-grams and lebaled rn-grams.

Some have argued, however, that such paradigms are highly susceptible to idiosyncratic strategies and that many findings do not reflect fundamental cognitive principles but are instead artifacts of averaging across participants who employ different strategies. We developed a set of techniques to rigorously test the extent to which average data are distorted by such strategy differences and applied these techniques to free recall data from the Penn Electrophysiology of Encoding and Retrieval Study. Recall initiation showed evidence of subgroups: The majority of participants initiated recall from the last item in the list, but one subgroup showed elevated initiation probabilities for items 2 to 4 positions back from the end of the list, and another showed elevated probabilities for the beginning of the list. By contrast, serial position curves and temporal and semantic clustering functions were remarkably consistent, with almost every participant exhibiting a recognizable version of the average function, suggesting that these functions reflect fundamental principles of the memory system. The approach taken here can serve as a model for evaluating the extent to which other laboratory paradigms are influenced by individual differences in strategy use.

While it is obvious that these oscillations play an important role in cognitive processing, it remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in {MEG} activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30-70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in the ongoing {MEG} signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase (e.g. at troughs) reflects a window of excitability.},

	abstract = {Episodic memory is characterized by rapid formation of new associations that bind information within individual episodes. A powerful aspect of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly apply and recombine information from past experience to guide new behavior. A critical question for memory research is how medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) and prefrontal cortex ({PFC}), regions implicated in rapid within-episode binding, further support cross-episode binding in service of mnemonic flexibility. We set to answer this question using an associative inference task in humans that required rapid binding of information across overlapping experiences ({AB}, {BC}) to enable successful transfer to novel test probes ({AC}). Within regions predicting subsequent associative memory for directly learned associations, encoding activation in {MTL}, including hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, uniquely predicted success on novel transfer trials both within and across participants, consistent with an integrative encoding mechanism where overlapping experiences are linked into a combined representation during learning. In contrast, during retrieval, {PFC} activation predicted trial-by-trial transfer success while {MTL} predicted transfer performance across participants. Moreover, increased {MTL}-{PFC} coupling was observed during novel transfer trials compared with retrieval of directly learned associations. These findings suggest that inferential processes support transfer of rapidly acquired experiences to novel events during retrieval where multiple memories are recalled and flexibly recombined in service of successful behavior. Together, these results demonstrate distinct encoding and retrieval mechanisms that support mnemonic flexibility, revealing a unique role for {MTL} regions in cross-episode binding during encoding and engagement of interactive {MTL}-{PFC} processes during flexible transfer at test.},

Examination of neural representations of space at fast time scales revealed a transient but repeatable phenomenon as rats made a decision: the location reconstructed from the neural ensemble swept forward, first down one path and then the other. Estimated representations were coherent and preferentially swept ahead of the animal rather than behind the animal, implying it represented future possibilities rather than recently traveled paths. Similar phenomena occurred at other important decisions (such as in recovery from an error). Local field potentials from these sites contained pronounced theta and gamma frequencies, but no sharp wave frequencies. Forward-shifted spatial representations were influenced by task demands and experience. These data suggest that the hippocampus does not represent space as a passive computation, but rather that hippocampal spatial processing is an active process likely regulated by cognitive mechanisms.},

Here we review these findings and suggest a new theoretical framework, the dual-task interaction model, that integrates these findings with current views of attentional selection. To reconcile the attentional boost effect with the effects of attentional load, we suggest that temporal selection results in a temporally specific enhancement across modalities, tasks, and spatial locations. Moreover, the effects of temporal selection may be best observed when the attentional system is optimally tuned to the temporal dynamics of incoming stimuli. Several avenues of research motivated by the dual-task interaction model are then discussed.},

Specifically, a multivariate pattern analysis failed to find evidence that information that was outside the focus of attention, but nonetheless in {STM}, was retained in an active state. Here, we replicate and extend this finding by querying the neural signatures of attended versus unattended information within {STM} with electroencephalograpy ({EEG}), a method sensitive to oscillatory neural activity to which the previous {fMRI} study was insensitive. We demonstrate that in the delay-period {EEG} activity, there is information only about memory items that are also in the focus of attention. Information about items outside the focus of attention is not detectable. This result converges with the {fMRI} findings to suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, an active memory trace may be unnecessary for the short-term retention of information.},

These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed {RSFC} correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in {RSFC} correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects.},

In Study 1, subjects were instructed to segment an actor's behavior into either fine, natural, or gross units of action. Fine-unit subjects subsequently remembered more details about the actor's behavior than did natural-unit subjects who, in turn, remembered more details than did gross-unit subjects. This result provides the first direct evidence {forD}. Newtson's (1973,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,28, 28–38) assertion that fine-unit perceivers are in a higher information state with regard to an observed other than are gross-unit perceivers. In Study 2, fine-unit subjects again significantly outperformed gross-unit subjects in terms of the number of action-related details they could remember even when memory was distorted by misleading postevent information. This result indicates that the link between unitization and action memory is quite robust. Study 2 also assessed subjects' memory for the nonaction-related or peripheral details of a behavior sequence. Reversing the pattern for action-related memory, gross-unit subjects performed better on a nonaction memory test than did fine-unit subjects. Thus,Newtson's (1973) hypothesis that a finer level of behavior perception is associated with greater information gain seems to hold only for action-related information. Finally, in Study 3 some artifactual interpretations of the results of Studies 1 and 2 were assessed and deemed untenable. Implications of the present findings for person memory, eyewitness testimony, and behavior perception research are discussed.},

In previous work, the right inferior parietal lobe ({IPL}) has been reported as one of the main brain regions related to sustained attention, however, the right lateralization of vigilance/sustained attention is unclear because information about the network for sustained attention is traditionally provided by neglect patients who typically have right brain damage. Here, we investigated sustained attention by applying a virtual lesion technique, transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}), over the left and right superior parietal lobe ({SPL}) and {IPL}. We used two different types of visual sustained attention tasks: spatial (location based) and non-spatial (feature based). When the participants performed the spatial task, repetitive {TMS} ({rTMS}) over either the right or left {IPL} induced a significant decrement of sustained attention causing a progressive increment of errors and response time. In contrast, participants' performance was not changed by {rTMS} on the non-spatial task. Also, omission errors (true negative) gradually increased with time on right and left {IPL} {rTMS} conditions, while commission errors (false positive) were relatively stable. These findings suggest that the maintenance of attention, especially in tasks regarding spatial location, is not uniquely lateralized to the right {IPL}, but may also involve participation of the left {IPL}.},

Current models of temporal organization in episodic memory have demonstrated that animals can make memory judgments about the order of serially presented events; however, in these protocols, the animals can judge items based on their relative recency. Thus, it remains unclear as to whether animals use the specific order of items in forming memories of distinct sequences. To resolve this important issue in memory representation, we presented mice repeatedly with two widely separated odor sequences and then tested their natural exploratory preference between pairs of odors selected from within or between sequences. Intact animals preferred to investigate odors that occurred earlier within each sequence, indicating they did remember the order of events within each distinct sequence. In contrast, intact animals did not discriminate between pairs of odors from different sequences. These findings indicate that preferences were not guided by relative recency, which would be expected to support graded discrimination between widely separated events. Furthermore, damage to either the hippocampus or the medial prefrontal cortex eliminated order preference within sequences. Despite the deficit in order memory, control recognition tests showed that normal mice and mice with hippocampal or medial prefrontal damage could correctly identify previously experienced odors compared with novel odors. These findings provide strong evidence that animals form representations of the order of events within specific experiences and that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are essential to order memory.},

A global theory of recognition and free recall that explains both types of forgetting and remembering from multiple list experiments is presented. The critical assumption of the model is that both intentional and unintentional forgetting are often due to contextual interference. Unintentional forgetting is the natural result of contextual changes between study and test. Intentional forgetting is accomplished by a rapid, metacognitively instigated change in mental context that renders to-be-forgotten information relatively inaccessible and renders to-be-remembered information more accessible (L. Sahakyan \& C. M. Kelley, 2002). This occurs for both recognition and free recall. Implications for item-method directed forgetting, exclusion recognition, source memory, and encoding operations are discussed.},

We found that reliably and continually changing cell assemblies in the rat hippocampus appeared not only during spatial navigation but also in the absence of changing environmental or body-derived inputs. During the delay period of a memory task, each moment in time was characterized by the activity of a particular assembly of neurons. Identical initial conditions triggered a similar assembly sequence, whereas different conditions gave rise to different sequences, thereby predicting behavioral choices, including errors. Such sequences were not formed in control (nonmemory) tasks.

In this article, we review common methods of spectral decomposition of {EEG}, time-frequency analyses, types of measures that separately quantify magnitude and phase information from the {EEG}, and the influence of parameter choices on the analysis results. We then compare the degree of phase locking (ie, phase-locking factor) of the gamma band (36–50 Hz) response evoked about 50 milliseconds following the presentation of standard tones in 22 healthy controls and 21 medicated patients with schizophrenia. These tones were presented as part of an auditory oddball task performed by subjects while {EEG} was recorded from their scalps. The results showed prominent gamma band phase locking at frontal electrodes between 20 and 60 milliseconds following tone onset in healthy controls that was significantly reduced in patients with schizophrenia (P = .03). The finding suggests that the early-evoked gamma band response to auditory stimuli is deficiently synchronized in schizophrenia. We discuss the results in terms of pathophysiological mechanisms compromising event-related gamma phase synchrony in schizophrenia and further attempt to reconcile this finding with prior studies that failed to find this effect.},

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the encoding of these and other types of temporal memory sequences is organized by gamma oscillations nested within theta oscillations. Here, we examined whether gamma-related firing of place cells permits such discrete temporal coding. We found that gamma-modulated {CA}1 pyramidal cells separated into two classes on the basis of gamma firing phases during waking theta periods. These groups also differed in terms of their spike waveforms, firing rates, and burst firing tendency. During gamma oscillations one group's firing became restricted to theta phases associated with the highest gamma power. Consequently, on the linear track, cells in this group often failed to fire early in theta-phase precession (as the rat entered the place field) if gamma oscillations were present. The second group fired throughout the theta cycle during gamma oscillations, and maintained gamma-modulated firing at different stages of theta-phase precession. Our results suggest that the two different pyramidal cell classes may support different types of population codes within a theta cycle: one in which spike sequences representing movement trajectories occur across subsequent gamma cycles nested within each theta cycle, and another in which firing in synchronized gamma discharges without temporal sequences encode a representation of location. We propose that gamma oscillations during theta-phase precession organize the mnemonic recall of population patterns representing places and movement paths.},

Relational processing refers to the encoding of similarities among a class of events and individual-item processing refers to encoding of item-specific information. Both forms of information are assumed to be important in retention, and the empirical argument for the distinction rests in part upon the reported demonstration of superior recall when both types of information are encoded. The experiments also demonstrate that variables influencing the type of processing, such as orienting instructions and the type of material, produce differential effects upon certain dependent measures. Thus, the data indicate facilitation of recall from the combination of relational and item-specific information, and further suggest the viability of a distinction between them because of differential effects of the two forms of processing upon recognition, clustering, and the relative recall of typical and atypical category instances.},

Furthermore, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence in humans suggests that medial temporal lobe cortical input structures, the perirhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortices, differentially participate in the encoding of objects and their context, providing domain-specific input to the hippocampus. Taken together, these data help to construct a working model of how distinct medial temporal lobe structures participate in episodic memory formation with domain-general relational binding mechanisms supported by the hippocampus and provide emerging evidence for domain-specificity within the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices.},

The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with real {MEG} data from a self-paced finger movement task. The algorithm reliably reveals modulations both in the beta band (12-30 Hz) and a high gamma band (65-90 Hz) in sensorimotor cortex. The performance is validated by both across-subjects statistical comparisons and by intracranial electrocorticography ({ECoG}) data from two epilepsy patients. We also revealed observed high gamma activity in the cerebellum. The proposed algorithm is highly parallelizable and runs efficiently on modern high performance computing clusters.

Prior work has implicated the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe cortex in memory for temporal information associated with individual episodes. However, the processes involved in encoding and retrieving temporal information across extended sequences is relatively poorly understood. Here we used {fMRI} during the encoding and retrieval of extended sequences to test specific predictions about the type of information used to resolve temporal order and the role of the hippocampus in this process. Participants studied sequences of images of celebrity faces and common objects followed by a recency discrimination test. The main conditions of interest were pairs of items that had been presented with three intervening items, half of which included an intervening category shift. During encoding, hippocampal pattern similarity across intervening items was associated with subsequent successful order memory. To test for evidence of associative retrieval, we trained a classifier to discriminate encoding patterns associated with faces versus objects and applied the classifier on {fMRI} patterns during recency discrimination. We found evidence that the category content of intervening items was reactivated during recency judgments, and this was related to hippocampal encoding-retrieval similarity. A follow-up behavioral priming experiment revealed additional evidence for intervening item reinstatement during temporal order judgments. Reinstatement did not differ according to whether the items occurred within a single context or across context boundaries. Thus, these data suggest that inter-item associative encoding and retrieval mediated by the hippocampus contribute to temporal order memory.},

As rats performed a value-guided decision-making task, the extent to which theta sequences projected ahead of the animal's current location varied on a moment-by-moment basis depending on the rat's goals. Look-ahead extended farther on journeys to distant goals than on journeys to more proximal goals and was predictive of the animal's destination. On arrival at goals, however, look-ahead was similar regardless of where the animal began its journey from. Together, these results provide evidence that hippocampal theta sequences contain information related to goals or intentions, pointing toward a potential spatial basis for planning.},

We hypothesize that beta oscillations and/or coupling in the beta-band are expressed more strongly if the maintenance of the status quo is intended or predicted, than if a change is expected.

	abstract = {The amount of information that can be stored in visual short-term memory is strictly limited to about four items [1]. Therefore, memory capacity relies not only on the successful retention of relevant information but also on efficient suppression of distracting information, visual attention, and executive functions 2, 3, 4 and 5. However, completely separable neural signatures for these memory capacity-limiting factors remain to be identified. Because of its functional diversity 6, 7, 8 and 9, oscillatory brain activity may offer a utile solution. In the present study, we show that capacity-determining mechanisms, namely retention of relevant information and suppression of distracting information, are based on neural substrates independent of each other: the successful maintenance of relevant material in short-term memory is associated with cross-frequency phase synchronization between theta (rhythmical neural activity around 5 Hz) and gamma ({\textgreater}50 Hz) oscillations at posterior parietal recording sites. On the other hand, electroencephalographic alpha activity (around 10 Hz) predicts memory capacity based on efficient suppression of irrelevant information in short-term memory. Moreover, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at alpha frequency can modulate short-term memory capacity by influencing the ability to suppress distracting information. Taken together, the current study provides evidence for a double dissociation of brain oscillatory correlates of visual short-term memory capacity.},

Here, we report electrophysiological findings that shed light on this issue. We monitored neural activity in the visual cortex of monkeys as they reported their perception of a high-contrast visual stimulus that was induced to vanish completely from perception on a subset of trials. We found that the spiking of neurons in cortical areas V1 and V2 was uncorrelated with the perceptual visibility of the target, whereas that in area V4 showed significant perception-related changes. In contrast, power changes in the lower frequency bands (particularly 9–30 Hz) of the local field potential ({LFP}), collected on the same trials, showed consistent and sustained perceptual modulation in all three areas. In addition, for the gamma frequency range (30–50 Hz), the responses during perceptual suppression of the target were correlated significantly with the responses to its physical removal in all areas, although the modulation magnitude was considerably higher in area V4 than in V1 and V2. These results, taken together, suggest that low-frequency {LFP} power in early cortical processing is more closely related to the representation of stimulus visibility than is spiking or higher frequency {LFP} activity.},

It has been repeatedly shown that frontoparietal theta coupling at ∼0° relative phase is associated with recognition, encoding, short-term retention, and planning [1, 4 and 5]; however, a causal link has not been demonstrated so far. Here we used transcranial alternating current stimulation [6, 7 and 8] simultaneously applied at 6 Hz over left prefrontal and parietal cortices with a relative 0° (“synchronized” condition) or 180° (“desynchronized” condition) phase difference or a placebo stimulation condition, whereas healthy subjects performed a delayed letter discrimination task. We show that exogenously induced frontoparietal theta synchronization significantly improves visual memory-matching reaction times as compared to placebo stimulation. In contrast, exogenously induced frontoparietal theta desynchronization deteriorates performance. The present findings provide for the first time evidence of causality of theta phase-coupling of distant cortical areas for cognitive performance in healthy humans. Moreover, the results demonstrate the suitability of transcranial alternating current stimulation to artificially induce coupling or decoupling of behaviorally relevant brain rhythms between segregated cortical regions.},

	abstract = {Magnetoencephalography provides precise information about the temporal dynamics of brain activation and is an ideal tool for investigating rapid cognitive processing. However, in many cognitive paradigms visual stimuli are used, which evoke strong brain responses (typically 40-100 {nAm} in V1) that may impede the detection of weaker activations of interest. This is particularly a concern when beamformer algorithms are used for source analysis, due to artefacts such as "leakage" of activation from the primary visual sources into other regions. We have previously shown (Quraan et al. 2011) that we can effectively reduce leakage patterns and detect weak hippocampal sources by subtracting the functional images derived from the experimental task and a control task with similar stimulus parameters. In this study we assess the performance of three different subtraction techniques. In the first technique we follow the same post-localization subtraction procedures as in our previous work. In the second and third techniques, we subtract the sensor data obtained from the experimental and control paradigms prior to source localization. Using simulated signals embedded in real data, we show that when beamformers are used, subtraction prior to source localization allows for the detection of weaker sources and higher localization accuracy. The improvement in localization accuracy exceeded 10 mm at low signal-to-noise ratios, and sources down to below 5 {nAm} were detected. We applied our techniques to empirical data acquired with two different paradigms designed to evoke hippocampal and frontal activations, and demonstrated our ability to detect robust activations in both regions with substantial improvements over image subtraction. We conclude that removal of the common-mode dominant sources through data subtraction prior to localization further improves the beamformer's ability to project the n-channel sensor-space data to reveal weak sources of interest and allows more accurate localization.},

During the course of learning, the amplitude of the low gamma subband (30–60 Hz) became more strongly modulated by theta phase in {CA}3, and higher levels of theta–gamma modulation were maintained throughout overtraining sessions. Furthermore, the strength of theta–gamma coupling was directly correlated with the increase in performance accuracy during learning sessions.

	abstract = {This paper examines the role of slow N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) channels (deactivation approximately 150 msec) in networks that multiplex different memories in different gamma subcycles of a low frequency theta oscillation. The {NMDA} channels are in the synapses of recurrent collaterals and govern synaptic modification in accord with known physiological properties. Because slow {NMDA} channels have a time constant that spans several gamma cycles, synaptic connections will form between cells that represent different memories. This enables brain structures that have slow {NMDA} channels to store heteroassociative sequence information in long-term memory. Recall of this stored sequence information can be initiated by presentation of initial elements of the sequence. The remaining sequence is then recalled at a rate of one memory every gamma cycle. A new role for the {NMDA} channel suggested by our finding is that recall at gamma frequency works well if slow {NMDA} channels provide the dominant component of the {EPSP} at the synapse of recurrent collaterals: The slow onset of these channels and their long duration allows the firing of one memory during one gamma cycle to trigger the next memory during the subsequent gamma cycle. An interesting feature of the readout mechanism is that the activation of a given memory is due to cumulative input from multiple previous memories in the stored sequence, not just the previous one. The network thus stores sequence information in a doubly redundant way: Activation of a memory depends on the strength of synaptic inputs from multiple cells of multiple previous memories. The cumulative property of sequence storage has support from the psychophysical literature. Cumulative learning also provides a solution to the disambiguation problem that occurs when different sequences have a region of overlap. In a final set of simulations, we show how coupling an autoassociative network to a heteroassociative network allows the storage of episodic memories (a unique sequence of briefly occurring known items). The autoassociative network (cortex) captures the sequence in short-term memory and provides the accurate, time-compressed repetition required to drive synaptic modification in the heteroassociative network (hippocampus). This is the first mechanistically detailed model showing how known brain properties, including network oscillations, recurrent collaterals, {AMPA} channels, {NMDA} channel subtypes, the {ADP}, and the {AHP} can act together to accomplish memory storage and recall.},

Two additional experiments discount alternative explanations in terms of the time to encode the test items or task strategies. Examination of the global memory models of Gillund and Shiffrin (1984), Hintzman (1988), and Murdock (1982) shows that the models treat item and associative information inseparably. Modifications to these models which can produce separate contributions for item and associative information do not predict any difference in their availability.

	abstract = {The principles of recency and contiguity are two cornerstones of the theoretical and empirical analysis of human memory. Recency has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay, displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955; Mensink \&amp; Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental state. This random context view has recently been incorporated into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997; Murdock, Smith, \&amp; Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative model. Rather than being driven by random fluctuations, this formulation, the temporal context model ({TCM}), uses retrieval of prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In {TCM}, retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This allows the model to provide a principled explanation of the widespread advantage for forward recalls in free and serial recall. Modeling data from single-trial free recall, we demonstrate that {TCM} can simultaneously explain recency and contiguity effects across time scales.},

We measured patterns of {fMRI} {BOLD} activity as people encoded items that were separated in time and manipulated the presence of shared or distinct context across items. We found that hippocampal pattern similarity in the {BOLD} response across trials predicted later temporal memory decisions when context changed. By contrast, pattern similarity in lateral occipital cortex was related to memory only when context remained stable.

	abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that demanding cognitive tasks rely on an extended network engaging task-relevant areas and, importantly, disengaging task-irrelevant areas. Given that alpha activity (8–12 Hz) has been shown to reflect the disengagement of task-irrelevant regions in attention and working memory tasks, we here ask if alpha activity plays a related role for long-term memory formation. Subjects were instructed to encode and maintain the order of word sequences while the ongoing brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography ({MEG}). In each trial, three words were presented followed by a 3.4 s rehearsal interval. Considering the good temporal resolution of {MEG} this allowed us to investigate the word presentation and rehearsal interval separately. The sequences were grouped in trials where word order either could be tested immediately (working memory trials; {WM}) or later ({LTM} trials) according to instructions. Subjects were tested on their ability to retrieve the order of the three words. The data revealed that alpha power in parieto-occipital regions was lower during word presentation compared to rehearsal. Our key finding was that parieto-occipital alpha power during the rehearsal period was markedly stronger for successfully than unsuccessfully encoded {LTM} sequences. This subsequent memory effect demonstrates that high posterior alpha activity creates an optimal brain state for successful {LTM} formation possibly by actively reducing parieto-occipital activity that might interfere with sequence encoding.

This process involves the reactivation of past mental states reflecting the perceptual and conceptual characteristics of the original experience. Widely distributed neural circuitry is engaged in the service of memory search, and the dynamics of these circuits are reflected in rhythmic oscillatory signals at widespread frequencies, recorded both in the local field around neurons and more globally at the scalp. Retrieved-context theory provides a theoretical bridge between the behavioral phenomena exhibited by participants in memory search tasks, and the neural signals reflecting the dynamics of the underlying circuitry. Computational models based on this theory make broad predictions regarding the representational structure of neural activity recorded during these tasks.

	abstract = {The present study examines whether readers of narratives focus on information relevant to the protagonist's perspective even when this information is implied rather than explicitly stated in the narrative. It also examines whether the protagonist's perspective is associated with this character's mental as well as physical location. We investigated these issues by conducting experiments in which subjects memorized a building layout and then read narratives that described a protagonist moving through the building while following a plan. Accessibility of object locations during reading was probed by interrupting the narrative and presenting the names of two objects from the building. Subjects indicated whether the objects were from the same room or from different rooms of the building. Experiment 1 investigated accessibility immediately after sentences that described the character moving from one room into another via a known but unmentioned path room. Readers answered questions about objects at the protagonist's current location (the goal room) more quickly than questions about objects in other rooms. Importantly, objects in the unmentioned path room were more accessible than those in mentioned but less relevant rooms. This finding shows that readers focus on information that is relevant to the protagonist by implication even if it is not mentioned. Experiments 2 and 3 show that the inferencing found in the first experiment depended more on the situational relevance of the implicit information than on other properties of the narratives or on the probe task. Experiment 2 also showed that the protagonist's location was less accessible than another location that the protagonist was thinking about. Thus, readers focused on the protagonist's “mental location” more than the physical location. Experiment 3 showed that the location room remained accessible so long as it was relevant to the protagonist's actions. Thus, the dynamics of accessibility during comprehension reflects the relevance of information to the current actions of the protagonist.},

	abstract = {The process of associating items encountered over time and across variable time delays is fundamental for creating memories in daily life, such as for stories and episodes. Forming associative memory for temporally discontiguous items involves medial temporal lobe structures and additional neocortical processing regions, including prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and lateral occipital regions. However, most prior memory studies, using concurrently presented stimuli, have failed to examine the temporal aspect of successful associative memory formation to identify when activity in these brain regions is predictive of associative memory formation. In the current study, functional {MRI} data were acquired while subjects were shown pairs of sequentially presented visual images with a fixed interitem delay within pairs. This design allowed the entire time course of the trial to be analyzed, starting from onset of the first item, across the 5.5-s delay period, and through offset of the second item. Subjects then completed a postscan recognition test for the items and associations they encoded during the scan and their confidence for each. After controlling for item-memory strength, we isolated brain regions selectively involved in associative encoding. Consistent with prior findings, increased regional activity predicting subsequent associative memory success was found in anterior medial temporal lobe regions of left perirhinal and entorhinal cortices and in left prefrontal cortex and lateral occipital regions. The temporal separation within each pair, however, allowed extension of these findings by isolating the timing of regional involvement, showing that increased response in these regions occurs during binding but not during maintenance.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal recordings show that different place cells fire at different phases during the same theta oscillation, probably at the peak of different gamma cycles. As the rat moves through the place field of a given cell, the phase of firing during the theta cycle advances progressively. In this paper we have sought to determine whether a recently developed model of hippocampal and cortical memory function can explain this phase advance and other properties of place cells. According to this physiologically based model, the {CA}3 network stores information about the sequence of places traversed during learning. Here we show that the phase advance can be understood if it is assumed that the hippocampus is in a recall mode that operates when the animal is already familiar with a path. In this mode, sensory information about the current position triggers recall of the upcoming 5-6 places (memories) in the path at a rate of one memory per gamma cycle. The model predicts that the average phase advance will be one gamma cycle per theta cycle, a value in reasonable agreement with the data. The model also correctly accounts for (1) the fact that the firing of a place cell occurs during approximately 7 theta cycles (on average) as the animal crosses the place field; (2) the observation that the phase of place cell firing depends more systematically on position than on time; and (3) the fact that traversal of an already familiar path produces further modifications (shifts the firing of a cell to an earlier position in the path). This later finding suggests that recall of previously stored information strengthens the memory of that information. In the model, this occurs because of a novel role of N-methyl-D-aspartate channels in recall. The general success of the model provides support for the idea that the hippocampus stores sequence information and makes predictions of expected positions during gamma-frequency recall.},

Event-related potentials recorded at encoding predicted the recall of both types of isolates. In recognition tests, the {IE} was obtained only when the encoding context was reinstated.

Here, we describe a novel variant of Atkinson and Shiffrin's buffer model within the framework of the retrieving effectively from memory theory ({REM}; Shiffrin \& Steyvers, 1997) that accounts for findings previously thought to be difficult for such models to explain. This model assumes a limited-capacity buffer where information is stored about items, along with information about associations between items and between items and the context in which they are studied. The strength of association between items and context is limited by the number of items simultaneously occupying the buffer (Lehman \& Malmberg, 2009). The contents of the buffer are managed by complementary processes of rehearsal and compartmentalization (Lehman \& Malmberg, 2011). New findings that directly test a priori predictions of the model are reported, including serial position effects and conditional and first recall probabilities in immediate and delayed free recall, in a continuous distractor paradigm, and in experiments using list-length manipulations of single-item and paired-item study lists.},

	abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling ({PAC}) has been proposed as a neural mechanism for coordinating information processing across brain regions. Here we sought to characterize {PAC} in the human hippocampus, and in temporal and frontal cortices, during the formation of new episodic memories. Intracranial recordings taken as 56 neurosurgical patients studied and recalled lists of words revealed significant hippocampal {PAC}, with slow-theta activity (2.5-5 Hz) modulating gamma band activity (34-130 Hz). Furthermore, a significant number of hippocampal electrodes exhibited greater {PAC} during successful than unsuccessful encoding, with the gamma activity at these sites coupled to the trough of the slow-theta oscillation. These same conditions facilitate {LTP} in animal models, providing a possible mechanism of action for this effect in human memory. Uniquely in the hippocampus, phase preference during item encoding exhibited a biphasic pattern. Overall, our findings help translate between the patterns identified during basic memory tasks in animals and those present during complex human memory encoding. We discuss the unique properties of human hippocampal {PAC} and how our findings relate to influential theories of information processing based on theta-gamma interactions.},

We aimed to resolve these conflicting results by using a cued-recall paradigm combined with a model-based data analysis method (Madan, Glaholt, \&amp; Caplan, 2010) that simultaneously obtains separate estimates of arousal effects on memory for associations and memory for items. Participants studied sequentially presented words in pairs that were pure ({NEGATIVE}–{NEGATIVE} or {NEUTRAL}–{NEUTRAL}) or mixed ({NEGATIVE}–{NEUTRAL} or {NEUTRAL}–{NEGATIVE}). Cued recall tests had {NEUTRAL} or {NEGATIVE} probes and {NEUTRAL} or {NEGATIVE} targets. We found impaired memory for associations involving negative words despite enhanced item-memory (more retrievable targets). A category-list control condition explained away the item-memory enhancement but could not explain the impairment of association-memory due to arousal. A second experiment with identical structure but using higher arousing taboo words revealed increased cued recall of taboo than neutral words. However, this was exclusively mediated by item-memory effects with neither enhancement nor impairment of association-memory. Thus, although cued recall was lower for pure negative pairs and higher for pure taboo pairs, our modeling approach determined a different locus of action for these memory impairing or increasing effects: Although item memory was increased by arousal, association-memory was impaired by moderately arousing, negative words and unaffected by taboo words. Our results suggest that previous results reporting an enhancement of association-memory due to arousal may have instead been solely driven by enhanced item-memory.},

	abstract = {Recent findings indicate that the hippocampus supports not only long-term memory encoding but also plays a role in working memory ({WM}) maintenance of multiple items; however, the neural mechanism underlying multi-item maintenance is still unclear. Theoretical work suggests that multiple items are being maintained by neural assemblies synchronized in the gamma frequency range (25-100 Hz) that are locked to consecutive phase ranges of oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz). Indeed, cross-frequency coupling of the amplitude of high-frequency activity to the phase of slower oscillations has been described both in animals and in humans, but has never been linked to a theoretical model of a cognitive process. Here we used intracranial {EEG} recordings in human epilepsy patients to test pivotal predictions from theoretical work. First, we show that simultaneous maintenance of multiple items in {WM} is accompanied by cross-frequency coupling of oscillatory activity in the hippocampus, which is recruited during multi-item {WM}. Second, maintenance of an increasing number of items is associated with modulation of beta/gamma amplitude with theta band activity of lower frequency, consistent with the idea that longer cycles are required for an increased number of representations by gamma cycles. This effect cannot be explained by a difference in theta or beta/gamma power. Third, we describe how the precision of cross-frequency coupling predicts individual {WM} performance. These data support the idea that working memory in humans depends on a neural code using phase information.},

	abstract = {Images that are presented with targets of an unrelated detection task are better remembered than images that are presented with distractors (the attentional boost effect). The likelihood that any of three mechanisms, attentional cuing, prediction-based reinforcement learning, and perceptual grouping, underlies this effect depends in part on how it is modulated by the relative timing of the target and image. Three experiments demonstrated that targets and images must overlap in time for the enhancement to occur; targets that appear 100 ms before or 100 ms after the image without temporally overlapping with it do not enhance memory of the image. However, targets and images need not be synchronized. A fourth experiment showed that temporal overlap of the image and target is not sufficient, as detecting targets did not enhance the processing of task-irrelevant images. These experiments challenge several simple accounts of the attentional boost effect based on attentional cuing, reinforcement learning, and perceptual grouping.},

Perceptual psychology provides an analogy to object perception: Like objects, events belong to categories, and, like objects, events have parts. These relationships generate 2 hierarchical organizations for events: taxonomies and partonomies. Event partonomies have been studied by looking at how people segment activity as it happens. Structured representations of events can relate partonomy to goal relationships and causal structure; such representations have been shown to drive narrative comprehension, memory, and planning. Computational models provide insight into how mental representations might be organized and transformed. These different approaches to event structure converge on an explanation of how multiple sources of information interact in event perception and conception.},

Recent electroencephalography data indicate that theta or beta frequencies at parietal sensors increase in amplitude when conscious perception is dominated by global or local features, respectively, of a reversible visual stimulus []. But this provides only correlative, noninterventional evidence. Here we show via transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) interventions that short rhythmic bursts of right-parietal {TMS} at theta or beta frequency can causally benefit processing of global or local levels, respectively, for hierarchical visual stimuli, especially in the context of salient incongruent distractors. This double dissociation between theta and beta {TMS} reveals distinct causal roles for particular frequencies in processing global versus local visual features.},

Conventional wavelet analyses and source localizations revealed {SMEs} in spectral power of theta-, alpha-, and gamma-band. Successful compared to unsuccessful encoding was reflected in increased theta-band activity in right frontal cortex as well as increased gamma-band activity in parietal-occipital regions. Moreover, decreased alpha-band activity in prefrontal and occipital cortex was also related to successful encoding. Overall, these findings support the idea that during the formation of new memories frontal cortex regions interact with cortical representations in posterior areas.},

Here, we used multivoxel pattern similarity analysis of {fMRI} data during retrieval of learned object sequences to systematically investigate hippocampal coding of object and temporal context information. Hippocampal activity patterns carried information about the temporal positions of objects in learned sequences, but not about objects or temporal positions in random sequences. Hippocampal activity patterns differentiated between overlapping object sequences and between temporally adjacent objects that belonged to distinct sequence contexts. Parahippocampal and perirhinal cortex showed different pattern information profiles consistent with coding of temporal position and object information, respectively. These findings are consistent with models proposing that the hippocampus represents objects within specific temporal contexts, a capability that might explain its critical role in episodic memory.},

Additionally, we investigated the differences between the subjects perceived and unperceived trials. The results show that Perceivers exhibited lower prestimulus alpha power than Non-Perceivers. Analysis of the prestimulus {EEG} between perceived and unperceived trials revealed that the perception of a stimulus is related to low phase coupling in the alpha frequency range (8-12 Hz) and high phase coupling in the beta and gamma frequency range (20-45 Hz). Single trial analyses showed that perception performance can be predicted by phase coupling in the alpha, beta and gamma frequency range. The findings indicate that synchronous oscillations in the alpha frequency band inhibit the perception of shortly presented stimuli whereas synchrony in higher frequency ranges ({\textgreater}20 Hz) enhances visual perception. We conclude that alpha, beta and gamma oscillations indicate the attentional state of a subject and thus are able to predict perception performance on a single trial basis.},

The disorganized exploration by amnesic patients occurred despite successful retention of individual object locations across the entire exploration period, indicating that exploration impairments were not secondary to rapid decay of scene information. These exploration deficits suggest that amnesic patients are impaired in integrating memory for recent actions, which may include information such as locations just visited and scene content, to plan immediately forthcoming actions.

Neuropsychological evidence also supports the idea that the prefrontal cortex is generally involved in processing complex events, such as action knowledge. Actions are represented in memory as sequences of goal-directed discrete events. Complex events can be divided into discrete smaller units and organised in a hierarchical manner. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of 9 patients with prefrontal lesion and 12 healthy controls to parse action sequences into meaningful events. Subjects were requested to detect the transitions between events under three different orientation instructions: (1) spontaneous; (2) small events; and (3) large event. Both normal subjects and patients identified significantly more events under the small-oriented condition. However, contrary to normal controls ({NCs}), patients with prefrontal damage showed considerable difficulties in detecting large event units than small event units. These results strongly suggest that prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in parsing and recognising clusters of action sequences. These findings also show that the way in which instructions orient subjects' attention, has an effect on how action information is encoded and represented in memory.},

Using magnetoencephalography-based decoding, we examined which brain activity patterns elicited during encoding are later replayed during recollection in the human brain. The results show that the recollection of images depicting faces and scenes is associated with a replay of neural representations that are formed at very early (180 ms) stages of encoding. This replay occurs quite rapidly, ∼500 ms after the onset of a cue that prompts recollection and correlates with source memory accuracy. Therefore, long-term memories are rapidly replayed during recollection and involve representations that were formed at very early stages of encoding. These findings indicate that very early representational information can be preserved in the memory engram and can be faithfully and rapidly reinstated during recollection. These novel insights into the nature of the memory engram provide constraints for mechanistic models of long-term memory function.},

Submodels for the recognition and retrieval processes are described. The recognition model assumes that during the study phase, S associates "list markers" to the to-be-recalled words. The establishment of such associates is postulated to be an all-or-none stochastic process. In the test phase, S recognizes to-be-recalled words by deciding which words have relevant list markers as associates. A signal detectability model is developed for this decision process. The retrieval model is introduced as a computer program that tags associative paths between list words. In 4 experiments, 41 male and 52 female 16-32 yr. old Ss studied and were tested on a sequence of overlapping sublists sampled from a master set of common nouns. Results confirm the prediction that S's ability to retrieve the words would increase as more overlapping sublists were studied, but his ability to differentiate the words on the most recent list should deteriorate. Further predictions derived from the free recall model were also supported. (56 ref.)},

Second, the length of the path is directly related to the length of the theta cycle and the number of gamma cycles in it. Finally, theta sequences represent the environment in segments or 'chunks'.

	abstract = {Although it is well established that remembering an item will bring to mind memories of other semantically related items (), the neural basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We studied how the similarity relations among items influence their retrieval by analyzing electrocorticographic ({ECoG}) recordings taken as 46 human neurosurgical patients studied and freely recalled lists of words. We first identified semantic components of neural activity that varied systematically with the meanings of each studied word, as defined by latent semantic analysis ({LSA}; ). We then examined the dynamics of these semantic components as participants attempted to recall the previously studied words. Our analyses revealed that the semantic components of neural activity were spontaneously reactivated during memory search, just prior to recall of the studied words. Further, the degree to which neural activity correlated with semantic similarity during recall predicted participants’ tendencies to organize the sequences of their responses on the basis of semantic similarity. Thus, our work shows that differences in the neural correlates of semantic information, and how they are reactivated prior to recall, reveal how individuals organize and retrieve memories of words.},

Although the medial temporal lobe (which includes the hippocampus and surrounding perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices) is known to be crucial for recognition memory, controversy remains regarding how the specific subregions within the medial temporal lobe contribute to recognition. We used event-related functional {MRI} to examine the relation between activation in distinct medial temporal lobe subregions during memory formation and the ability (i) to later recognize an item as previously encountered (item recognition) and (ii) to later recollect specific contextual details about the prior encounter (source recollection). Encoding activation in hippocampus and in posterior parahippocampal cortex predicted later source recollection, but was uncorrelated with item recognition. In contrast, encoding activation in perirhinal cortex predicted later item recognition, but not subsequent source recollection. These outcomes suggest that the subregions within the medial temporal lobe subserve distinct, but complementary, learning mechanisms.},

While a significant number of recent publications reported activations from deep brain structures, others reported their inability to detect such activity even when other detection modalities confirmed its presence. In this article, we relied on realistic simulations to show that both sides of this debate are correct and that these findings are reconcilable. We show that the ability to detect such activations in evoked responses depends on the signal strength, the amount of brain noise background, the experimental design parameters, and the methodology used to detect them. Furthermore, we show that small signal strengths require contrasts with control conditions to be detected, particularly in the presence of strong brain noise backgrounds. We focus on one localization technique, the adaptive spatial filter (beamformer), and examine its strengths and weaknesses in reconstructing hippocampal activations, in the presence of other strong brain sources such as visual activations, and compare the performance of the vector and scalar beamformers under such conditions. We show that although a weight-normalized beamformer combined with a multisphere head model is not biased in the presence of uncorrelated random noise, it can be significantly biased in the presence of correlated brain noise. Furthermore, we show that the vector beamformer performs significantly better than the scalar under such conditions. We corroborate our findings empirically using real data and demonstrate our ability to detect and localize such sources.},

While much controversy surrounds the particular types of memories the hippocampus is thought to support, one hypothesized function possibly linking divergent frameworks is the capacity to bind mnemonic representations across spatial and temporal gaps in our experience. In our current functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study, we systematically controlled the extent to which a target and an event detail have to be integrated across spatiotemporal discontiguities during associative memory formation. Although the encoding task, the type of association, and subsequent memory performance were held constant, engagement of the hippocampus during successful associative binding was directly modulated by increases in spatial and temporal discontiguities across episodic elements. These results suggest that a core mnemonic function of the hippocampus is to bridge representational gaps in our experience.},

	abstract = {The activity of individual hippocampal principal neurons is spatially localized such that each neuron is active only when the animal occupies an area of the environment known as the cell's place field. Additionally, the activity of hippocampal neurons exhibits a particular temporal relationship to the hippocampal {EEG}, such that spikes fired by the neuron occur at progressively earlier phases of the co-occurring theta rhythm in the {EEG} as the animal traverses the place field. This relationship is known as theta precession. A long-standing prediction following the observation of theta precession has been that among a collection of hippocampal neurons recorded simultaneously, the neurons will fire in sequences reflecting the behavioral order of the place fields. Here we examine this prediction. We show that clear, ordered sequences occur during theta, which we name theta sequences, in which a portion of the animal's spatial experience is played out in forwards order. We further investigate the relationship of theta sequences to phase precession by shuffling spike phases in such a way as to preserve the relationship between spike phase and position. This jitter significantly reduces the prevalence of theta sequences while leaving theta phase precession intact, suggesting that the presence of theta phase precession is not trivially predictive of theta sequences. Finally, we discuss the relationship between theta sequences and individual place fields, and the possible functional role of theta sequences in navigational learning.},

	abstract = {The medial temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex and parts of parietal cortex form the neural underpinnings of episodic memory, which includes remembering both where and when an event occurred. However, the manner in which these three regions interact during retrieval of spatial and temporal context remains untested. We employed simultaneous electrocorticographical recordings across multilobular regions in patients undergoing seizure monitoring while they retrieved spatial and temporal context associated with an episode, and we used phase synchronization as a measure of network connectivity. Successful memory retrieval was characterized by greater global connectivity compared with incorrect retrieval, with the medial temporal lobe acting as a hub for these interactions. Spatial versus temporal context retrieval resulted in prominent differences in both the spectral and temporal patterns of network interactions. These results emphasize dynamic network interactions as being central to episodic memory retrieval, providing insight into how multiple contexts underlying a single event can be recreated in the same network.

	abstract = {There is strong evidence to suggest that data recorded from magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) follows a non-Gaussian distribution. However, existing standard methods for source localisation model the data using only second order statistics, and therefore use the inherent assumption of a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we present a new general method for non-Gaussian source estimation of stationary signals for localising brain activity from {MEG} data. By providing a Bayesian formulation for {MEG} source localisation, we show that the source probability density function (pdf), which is not necessarily Gaussian, can be estimated using multivariate kernel density estimators. In the case of Gaussian data, the solution of the method is equivalent to that of widely used linearly constrained minimum variance ({LCMV}) beamformer. The method is also extended to handle data with highly correlated sources using the marginal distribution of the estimated joint distribution, which, in the case of Gaussian measurements, corresponds to the null-beamformer. The proposed non-Gaussian source localisation approach is shown to give better spatial estimates than the {LCMV} beamformer, both in simulations incorporating non-Gaussian signals, and in real {MEG} measurements of auditory and visual evoked responses, where the highly correlated sources are known to be difficult to estimate.},

This partitioning of continuous activity may occur, in part, because events correspond to dynamic patterns that have recurred across different contexts.

The current set of simulations investigated whether this statistical structure within events can be used 1) to develop stable internal representations that facilitate perception and 2) to learn when to update such representations in a self-organizing manner. These simulations demonstrate that experience with recurring patterns enables a system to accurately predict upcoming stimuli within an event, to identify boundaries between such events based on transient increases in prediction error, and to use such boundaries to improve prediction about subsequent activities.},

	abstract = {A spatial filtering method for localizing sources of brain electrical activity from surface recordings is described and analyzed. The spatial filters are implemented as a weighted sum of the data recorded at different sites. The weights are chosen to minimize the filter output power subject to a linear constraint. The linear constraint forces the filter to pass brain electrical activity from a specified location, while the power minimization attenuates activity originating at other locations. The estimated output power as a function of location is normalized by the estimated noise power as a function of location to obtain a neural activity index map. Locations of source activity correspond to maxima in the neural activity index map. The method does not require any prior assumptions about the number of active sources of their geometry because it exploits the spatial covariance of the source electrical activity. This paper presents a development and analysis of the method and explores its sensitivity to deviations between actual and assumed data models. The effect on the algorithm of covariance matrix estimation, correlation between sources, and choice of reference is discussed.

Here, we studied human brain lesion patients to determine whether the superior parietal lobule is indeed necessary for working memory. We assessed a wide range of memory functions in three participant groups: superior parietal lesions (n = 19), lesions not involving superior parietal cortex (n = 146), and no brain lesions (n = 55). Superior parietal damage was reliably associated with deficits on tests involving the manipulation and rearrangement of information in working memory, but not on working memory tests requiring only rehearsal and retrieval processes, nor on tests of long-term memory.

	abstract = {Learning through reward is central to adaptive behavior. Indeed, items are remembered better if they are experienced while participants expect a reward, and people can deliberately prioritize memory for high- over low-valued items. Do memory advantages for high-valued items only emerge after deliberate prioritization in encoding? Or, do reward-based memory enhancements also apply to unrewarded memory tests and to implicit memory? First, we tested for a high-value memory advantage in unrewarded implicit- and explicit-tests (Experiment 1). Participants first learned high or low-reward values of 36 words, followed by unrewarded lexical decision and free-recall tests. High-value words were judged faster in lexical decision, and more often recalled in free recall. These two memory advantages for high-value words were negatively correlated suggesting at least two mechanisms by which reward value can influence later item-memorability. The ease with which the values were originally acquired explained the negative correlation: people who learned values earlier showed reward effects in implicit memory whereas people who learned values later showed reward effects in explicit memory. We then asked whether a high-value advantage would persist if trained items were linked to a new context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Following the same value training as in Experiment 1, participants learned lists composed of previously trained words mixed with new words, each followed by free recall. Thus, participants had to retrieve words only from the most recent list, irrespective of their values. High- and low-value words were recalled equally, but low-value words were recalled earlier than high-value words and high-value words were more often intruded (proactive interference). Thus, the high-value advantage holds for implicit- and explicit-memory, but comes with a side effect: High-value items are more difficult to relearn in a new context. Similar to emotional arousal, reward value can both enhance and impair memory.},

To test this theoretical framework we recorded neuromagnetic responses from 10 subjects performing the Sternberg task. Subjects were required to retain a list of 1, 3, 5 or 7 visually presented digits during a 3-s retention period. During the retention period we observed ongoing frontal theta activity in the 7-8.5-Hz band recorded by sensors over frontal brain areas. The activity in the theta band increased parametrically with the number of items retained in working memory. A time-frequency analysis revealed that the task-dependent theta was present during the retention period and during memory scanning. Following the memory task the theta activity was reduced. These results suggest that theta oscillations generated in frontal brain regions play an active role in memory maintenance.},

On page 270, it is stated that “The vector {vGV} is divided by its sum.” This division should be applied before multiplication by {piCG} in Equation A11. Following Equation A15 it is stated that p was set to a value of 0.3; in fact, this is the weighting of {vPV}, so that p should be set to a value of 0.7. Finally, in Equation A16, no normalization should be applied; the corrected Equation A16 is presented in the erratum. This also means that the description of the process of recall on page 227, 6th line from the bottom left column, should be amended to exclude “Item activations are normalized to sum to 1”.] A model of short-term memory and episodic memory is presented, with the core assumptions that (a) people parse their continuous experience into episodic clusters and (b) items are clustered together in memory as episodes by binding information within an episode to a common temporal context. Along with the additional assumption that information within a cluster is serially ordered, the model accounts for a number of phenomena from short-term memory (with a focus on serial recall) and episodic memory (with a focus on free recall). The model also accounts for the effects of aging on serial and free recall, apparent temporal isolation effects in short- and long-term memory, and the relation between individual differences in working memory and episodic memory performance.},

Participants were scanned while memorizing item-triplets including simultaneous and discontinuous associations. Subsequent memory tests showed that participants remembered both types of associations equally well. First, by constructing the contrast between the subsequent memory effects for discontinuous associations and simultaneous associations, we identified the left posterior parahippocampal region, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, posterior midline structures, and the middle temporal gyrus as being specifically involved in transforming discontinuous associations into episodic memory. Second, we replicated that the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) especially the hippocampus are involved in associative memory formation in general. Our findings provide evidence for distinct neural operation(s) that supports the binding and storing discontinuous associations in memory. We suggest that top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex and {MTL} may trigger reactivation of internal representation in posterior midline structures of the first event, thus allowing it to be associated with the second event. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex together with basal ganglia may support this encoding operation by executive and binding processes within working memory, and the posterior parahippocampal region may play a role in binding and memory formation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In Exp I, Ss were given incidental learning instructions that directed attention either to relational aspects of items in a list or to the individual items themselves or to both. This processing was either semantic or nonsemantic in nature. The typical levels-of-processing effect was observed with the semantic and nonsemantic tasks for both relational and individual-item processing. Free-recall and recognition performances were determined by the additive combination of relational processing and individual-item processing. Also, the 2 kinds of processing had functionally different effects on memory when clustering, recognition scores, and false alarms were examined. Relational processing apparently enhanced the formation of retrieval schemes, whereas individual-item processing seemed to facilitate discriminative processes. In Exp {II}, the relative importance of relational and individual-item processing was dependent on the saliency of the structure of the learning materials. It is argued that the distinction between these 2 types of processing should be considered in relation to the structure of the learning material and to the type of memory task. (19 ref)},

To study the relative contribution of phased-coded and rate-coded information, we reconstructed the animal's position on a linear track using spikes recorded simultaneously from 38 hippocampal neurons. Two previous studies of this kind found no evidence that phase information substantially improves reconstruction accuracy. We have found that reconstruction is improved provided epochs with large, systematic errors are first excluded. With this condition, use of both phase and rate information improves the reconstruction accuracy by {\textbackslash}textgreater43\% as compared with the use of rate information alone. Furthermore, it becomes possible to predict the rat's position on a 204-cm track with very high accuracy (error of {\textbackslash}textless3 cm). The best reconstructions were obtained with more than three phase divisions per theta cycle. These results strengthen the hypothesis that information in rat hippocampal place cells is encoded by the phase of theta at which cells fire.},

	abstract = {Recordings from brain regions involved in memory function show dual oscillations in which each cycle of a low-frequency theta oscillation (5-8 Hz) is subdivided into about seven subcycles by high frequency gamma oscillations (20-60 Hz). It has been proposed (Lisman and Idiart 1995) that such networks are a multiplexed short-term memory ({STM}) buffer that can actively maintain about seven memories, a capability of human {STM}. A memory is encoded by a subset of principal neurons that fire synchronously in a particular gamma subcycle. Firing is maintained by a membrane process intrinsic to each cell. We now extend this model by incorporating recurrent connections with modifiable synapses to store long-term memory ({LTM}). The repetition provided by {STM} gradually modifies synapses in a physiologically realistic way. Because different memories are active in different gamma subcycles, the formation of autoassociative {LTM} requires that synaptic modification depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) channels having a time constant of deactivation that is of the same order as the duration of a gamma subcycle (15-50 msec). Many types of {NMDA} channels have longer time constants (150 msec), as for instance those found in the hippocampus, but both fast and slow {NMDA} channels are present in cortex. This is the first proposal for the special role of these fast {NMDA} channels. The {STM} for novel items must depend on activity-dependent changes intrinsic to neurons rather than recurrent connections, which have not developed the required selectivity. Because these intrinsic mechanisms are not error-correcting, {STM} will become slowly corrupted by noise. This limits the accuracy with which {LTM} can become encoded after a single presentation. Accurate encoding of items in {LTM} can be achieved by multiple presentations, provided different memory items are presented in a varied interleaved order. Our results indicate that a limited memory-capacity {STM} model can be integrated in the same network with a high-capacity {LTM} model.},

Subjects detected brief light flashes that were presented peripherally at locations that were either attended or unattended. We analyzed the correlation between detection performance for attended and unattended stimuli and the phase of ongoing {EEG} oscillations, which relate to subsecond fluctuations of neuronal excitability. Although on average, detection performance was improved by attention—indicated by reduced detection thresholds at attended locations—we found that detection performance for attended stimuli actually fluctuated over time along with the phase of spontaneous oscillations in the θ (≈7 Hz) frequency band just before stimulus onset. This fluctuation was absent for unattended stimuli. This pattern of results suggests that “sustained” attention in fact exerts its facilitative effect on perception in a periodic fashion.},

	abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane.2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec.3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells.4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments.5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (;frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation.6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

We examined the neural predictions of these models by using electrocorticographic/depth recordings and scalp electroencephalography ({EEG}) to characterize category-specific oscillatory activity, while participants studied and recalled items from distinct, neurally discriminable categories. During study, these category-specific patterns predict whether a studied item will be recalled. In the scalp {EEG} experiment, category-specific activity during study also predicts whether a given item will be recalled adjacent to other same-category items, consistent with the proposal that a category-specific retrieval cue is used to guide memory search. Retrieved-context models suggest that integrative neural circuitry is involved in the construction and maintenance of the retrieval cue. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe category-specific patterns that rise in strength as multiple same-category items are studied sequentially, and find that individual differences in this category-specific neural integration during study predict the degree to which a participant will use category information to organize memory search. Finally, we track the deployment of this retrieval cue during memory search: Category-specific patterns are stronger when participants organize their responses according to the category of the studied material.},

Using performance on a retrieval test, encoding activations predictive of subsequent triplet recognition (“hits” vs. “misses”) as well as activations differentiating triplets that were subsequently recognized with (ordered) and without (misordered) memory for the original sequence of presentation were identified. Within the {MTL}, activations in bilateral hippocampal and parahippocampal cortical regions predicted subsequent order memory, with greater activations observed during encoding of triplets subsequently correctly ordered than those subsequently misordered. Interestingly, activation in these regions did not correlate with old/new triplet identification, suggesting that these {MTL} regions contributed specifically to encoding of episodic details supporting subsequent recovery of sequence information.},

	abstract = {Episodic memory allows people to reexperience the past by recovering the sequences of events that characterize those prior experiences. Although experience is continuous, people are able to selectively retrieve and reexperience more discrete episodes from their past, raising the possibility that some elements become tightly related to each other in memory, whereas others do not. The current series of experiments was designed to ask how shifts in context during an experience influence how people remember the past. Specifically, we asked how context shifts influence the ability to remember the relative order of past events, a hallmark of episodic memory. We found that memory for the order of events was enhanced within, rather than across, context shifts, or boundaries (Experiment 1). Next, we showed that this relative enhancement in order memory was eliminated when across-item associative processing was disrupted (Experiment 2), suggesting that context shifts have a selective effect on sequential binding. Finally, we provide evidence that the act of making order memory judgments involves the reactivation of representations that bridged the tested items (Experiment 3). Together, these data suggest that boundaries may serve to parse continuous experience into sequences of contextually related events and that this organization facilitates remembering the temporal order of events that share the same context.

Models of short-term memory that are based on such persistent firing properties of specific neurons can meet the requirements of spike-timing–dependent potentiation of synaptic strengths during the encoding of a temporal sequence of spike patterns. We show that such a spiking buffer can be simulated with integrate-and-fire neurons that include a leak current even when different numbers of spikes represent successive items. We propose a mechanism that successfully replaces items in the buffer in first-in–first-out ({FIFO}) order when the distribution of spike density in a theta cycle is asymmetric, as found in experimental data. We predict effects on the function and capacity of the buffer model caused by changes in modeled theta cycle duration, the timing of input to the buffer, the strength of recurrent inhibition, and the strength and timing of after-hyperpolarization and after-depolarization ({ADP}). Shifts of input timing or changes in {ADP} parameters can enable the reverse-order buffering of items, with {FIFO} replacement in a full buffer. As noise increases, the simulated buffer provides robust output that may underlie episodic encoding.},

Intracanial electrode recordings provide a high spatial resolution method for studying such oscillations during cognitive tasks. Recent work revealed sites at which oscillations in the theta range (4–12 Hz) could be gated by a working-memory task: theta power was increased at task onset and continued until task offset. Using a large data set that has now been collected (10 participants/619 recording sites), we have sufficient sampling to determine how these gated sites are distributed in the cortex and how they are synchronized. A substantial fraction of sites in occipital/parietal (45/157) and temporal (23/280) cortices were gated by the task. Surprisingly, this aspect of working-memory function was virtually absent in frontal cortex (2/182). Coherence measures were used to analyze the synchronization of oscillations. We suspected that because of their coordinate regulation by the working-memory task, gated sites would have synchronized theta oscillations. We found that, whereas nearby gated sites ({\textless}20 mm) were often but not always coherent, distant gated sites were almost never coherent. Our results imply that there are local mechanisms for the generation of cortical theta.},

Little is known about the regions that support the encoding of temporal information in the human brain, although previous work has suggested a role for the lateral prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) and medial temporal lobes ({MTL}). Here we used event-related {fMRI} to examine the relationship between activity at encoding and subsequent memory for temporal context. Participants were scanned while performing a serial order working memory task with pictures of common objects and were later tested for temporal memory at two different timescales. In the coarse temporal memory test, participants viewed one object from each trial and indicated approximately when during the course of the experiment it had appeared. In the fine temporal memory test, participants were shown the remaining objects from each trial and asked to recall the order in which they had been originally presented. Activity in the parahippocampal cortex predicted subsequent fine temporal accuracy, whereas coarse temporal accuracy was predicted by activity in several regions of the {PFC}, as well as in the hippocampus. Additional multivoxel pattern analyses revealed evidence implicating the rostrolateral {PFC} in the representation of time-varying contextual states in a manner similar to that proposed by computational theories of temporal context memory. These results highlight {MTL} and {PFC} contributions to temporal memory at the time of encoding and suggest a particular role for the rostrolateral {PFC} in encoding coarse temporal context.},

This suggests that event segmentation during encoding resulted in segmentation of those same events in memory. Further, functional imaging data revealed that, across participants, brain activity consistent with the ongoing integration of information within events correlated with this pattern of mnemonic segmentation. These data are the first to address the mechanisms that support the organization of experiences into episodes in long-term memory.},

This process, called event segmentation, separates "what is happening now? from "what just happened." In this study, we show that event segmentation predicts activity in the hippocampus when people access recent information. Participants watched narrative film and occasionally attempted to retrieve from memory objects that recently appeared in the film. The delay between object presentation and test was always 5 sec. Critically, for some of the objects, the event changed during the delay whereas for others the event continued. Using {fMRI}, we examined whether retrieval-related brain activity differed when the event changed during the delay. Brain regions involved in remembering past experiences over long periods, including the hippocampus, were more active during retrieval when the event changed during the delay. Thus, the way an object encountered just 5 sec ago is retrieved from memory appears to depend in part on what happened in those 5 sec. These data strongly suggest that the segmentation of ongoing activity into events is a control process that regulates when memory for events is updated.},

It is crucial for many studies to use magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) to assess the ability to detect subcortical generators. This study aims to assess the source localization accuracy and to compare the characteristics of three inverse operators in the specific case of subcortical generators. {MEG} has a low sensitivity to subcortical sources mainly because of their distance from sensors and their complex cyto-architecture. However, we show that using a realistic anatomical and electrophysiological model of deep brain activity ({DBA}), the sources make measurable contributions to {MEG} sensors signals. Furthermore, we study the point-spread and cross-talk functions of the {wMNE}, {sLORETA} and {dSPM} inverse operators to characterize distortions in cortical and subcortical regions and to study how noise-normalization methods can improve or bias accuracy. We then run Monte Carlo simulations with neocortical and subcortical activations. In the case of single hippocampus patch activations, the results indicate that {MEG} can indeed localize the generators in the head and the body of the hippocampus with good accuracy. We then tackle the question of simultaneous cortical and subcortical activations. {wMNE} can detect hippocampal activations that are embedded in cortical activations that have less than double their amplitude, but it does not completely correct the bias to more superficial sources. {dSPM} and {sLORETA} can still detect hippocampal activity above this threshold, but such detection might include the creation of ghost deeper sources. Finally, using the {DBA} model, we showed that the detection of weak thalamic modulations of ongoing brain activity is possible.},

For each individual observer, we isolated the stimulus spatial frequency ({SF}) features underlying their overt judgments of the input as “the nuns” and “Voltaire”. Every 2 ms between stimulus onset and overt response, we derived the sensitivity of the observer's oscillatory brain activity (in the theta, alpha, and beta bandwidths) to these {SF} features. Then, in each bandwidth, we estimated the moments (between stimulus onset and perceptual judgment) when perception-specific {SF} features were maximally integrated, corresponding to perceptual moments. We show that the centroparietal beta oscillations support perceptual moments underlying the conscious perception of the nuns, whereas theta oscillations support the perception of Voltaire.

Here, we use the Context Maintenance and Retrieval model of free recall ({CMR}; Polyn et al., 2009a) to interpret variability in the strength of task-specific patterns of distributed neural activity as participants study and recall lists of words. The {CMR} model describes how temporal and source-related (here, encoding task) information combine in a contextual representation that is responsible for guiding memory search. Each studied word in the free-recall paradigm is associated with one of two encoding tasks (size and animacy) that have distinct neural representations during encoding. We find evidence for the context retrieval hypothesis central to the {CMR} model: Task-specific patterns of neural activity are reactivated during memory search, as the participant recalls an item previously associated with a particular task. Furthermore, we find that the fidelity of these task representations during study is related to task-shifting, the serial position of the studied item, and variability in the magnitude of the recency effect across participants. The {CMR} model suggests that these effects may be related to a central parameter of the model that controls the rate that an internal contextual representation integrates information from the surrounding environment.},

Each memory is stored in a different high-frequency ("40 hertz") subcycle of a low-frequency oscillation. Memory patterns repeat on each low-frequency (5 to 12 hertz) oscillation, a repetition that relies on activity-dependent changes in membrane excitability rather than reverberatory circuits.

We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning. Subsequent optogenetic delivery of {LTD} conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of {LTP} conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock.

Simulations with synthetic data suggest that distortion of brain signals is minimal. The method surpasses previous methods by synthesizing, for each reference/brain sensor pair, a filter that compensates for convolutive mismatches between sensors. The method enhances the value of data recorded in health and scientific applications by suppressing harmful noise, and reduces the need for deleterious spatial or spectral filtering.

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations of different frequencies can interact in several ways. There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling ({CFC}). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude {CFC}. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback-Leibler distance-a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions-and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a {CFC} measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other {CFC} measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related {CFC} tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the {CA}3 and {CA}1 regions present different {CFC} characteristics.},

	abstract = {Background/Study Context: Temporal sequence learning is a critical aspect of episodic memory that may be dependent on the temporal and frontal lobes. Because amnestic mild cognitive impairment ({aMCI}) and normal aging may result in changes within the temporal and frontal lobes, the present study investigated temporal sequence learning in patients with {aMCI}, cognitively normal older adults, and young adults. Methods: On each trial of a temporal sequence task, circles appeared one at a time at the end of each arm of a computerized radial eight-arm maze. Participants were asked to reproduce the temporal sequence by placing numbered circles (1 to 8) on the arms of the eight-arm maze. Participants were presented with the same fixed sequence on each trial until the sequence was replicated without any errors, or until 15 trials were presented. Results: Individuals with {aMCI} required significantly more trials to learn the temporal sequence compared with older adults (p {\textless} .05). Older adults required significantly more trials to learn the sequence than young adults (p {\textless} .05). Older adults and individuals with {aMCI} committed significantly more Trial 1 errors (p {\textless} .05) than young adults; however, there were no significant differences between the {aMCI} and older adult groups on Trial 1. Conclusion: The results suggest that temporal sequence learning deficits are detectable in {aMCI}. These deficits may disrupt a number of cognitive processes, such as episodic memory, that are important for the execution of daily activities. The results suggest that although temporal sequence learning declines with normal aging, this decline is greater in individuals who have a diagnosis of {aMCI} and are at higher risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.},

Here, we present an account of the nature of psychological representations of events and how they are constructed and updated. Event representations are like images in that they are isomorphic to the situations they represent. However, they are like models or language in that they are constructed of components rather than being holistic. Also, they are partial representations that leave out some elements and abstract others. Representations of individual events are informed by schematic knowledge about general classes of events. Event representations are constructed in a process that segments continuous activity into discrete events. The construction of a series of event representations forms a basis for predicting the future, planning for that future, and imagining alternatives.},

	abstract = {Human episodic memory is highly context dependent. Therefore, retrieval benefits when a memory is recalled in the same context compared to a different context. This implies that items and contexts are bound together during encoding, such that the reinstatement of the initial context at test improves retrieval. Animal studies suggest that theta oscillations and theta-to-gamma cross-frequency coupling modulate such item-context binding, but direct evidence from humans is scarce. We investigated this issue by manipulating the overlap of contextual features between encoding and retrieval. Participants studied words superimposed on movie clips and were later tested by presenting the word with either the same or a different movie. The results show that memory performance and the oscillatory correlates of memory formation crucially depend on the overlap of the context between encoding and test. When the context matched, high theta power during encoding was related to successful recognition, whereas the opposite pattern emerged in the context-mismatch condition. In addition, cross-frequency coupling analysis revealed a context-dependent theta-to-gamma memory effect specifically in the left hippocampus. These results reveal for the first time that context-dependent episodic memory effects are mediated by theta oscillatory activity.},

Results indicated that subjects viewing breakpoints were (a) significantly more accurate in action descriptions, (b) rated the sequence as more intelligible, and (c) more accurately judged the correctness of slide ordering.

In Experiment 1, the degree of immersion was reduced by using smaller displays. In comparison, in Experiment 2 an actual, rather than a virtual, environment was used, to maximize immersion. Location-updating effects were observed under both of these conditions. In Experiment 3, the original encoding context was reinstated by having a person return to the original room in which objects were first encoded. However, inconsistent with an encoding specificity account, memory did not improve by reinstating this context. Finally, we did a further analysis of the results of this and previous experiments to assess the differential influence of foregrounding and retrieval interference.

The lag recency effect, previously observed in immediate free recall, was also observed in delayed and continuous distractor free recall. Although two-store memory models, such as {SAM}, readily account for the end-of-list recency effect in immediate free recall, and its attenuation in delayed free recall, these models fail to account for the long-term recency effect. By means of analytic simulations, the authors show that both the end of list recency effect and the lag recency effect, across all distractor conditions, can be explained by a single-store model in which context, retrieved with each recalled item, serves as a cue for subsequent recalls.},

Newtson, 1973) influences the subsequent recall, but not recognition, of action-related details from that event. They thus concluded that level of unitization affects how information is represented in memory but not what information is represented. Previous articles (G. D. Lassiter [see {PA}, Vol 76:11778]; and Lassiter et al [see {PA}, Vol 76:8393]), however, conflict with Hanson and Hirst in reporting that both the recall and the recognition of events are influenced by level of unitization. Meta-analyses of these combined data show that the discrepancy between Hanson and Hirst and earlier work is more illusory than real and, most important, clearly indicate the existence of an effect of level of unitization on recognition as well as recall. On the basis of these results, it is argued that level of unitization does indeed affect what information is represented in memory.},

In principle, the theory can apply to item recognition, order recognition, probe and ordered recall, judgments of recency and frequency, lexical decision, and storage of higher-order units such as chunks or propositions. It applies to both accuracy and latency. Performance is predicted from the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and these can be derived from the theory.

What kind of representations support such rapid statistical learning? The medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) can represent information from even a single experience, making it a good candidate system for assisting in initial learning about regularities. We combined anatomical segmentation of the {MTL}, high-resolution {fMRI}, and multivariate pattern analysis to identify representations of objects in cortical and hippocampal areas of human {MTL}, assessing how these representations were shaped by exposure to regularities. Subjects viewed a continuous visual stream containing hidden temporal relationships--pairs of objects that reliably appeared nearby in time. We compared the pattern of blood oxygen level-dependent activity evoked by each object before and after this exposure, and found that perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, subiculum, {CA}1, and {CA}2/{CA}3/dentate gyrus ({CA}2/3/{DG}) encoded regularities by increasing the representational similarity of their constituent objects. Most regions exhibited bidirectional associative shaping, whereas {CA}2/3/{DG} represented regularities in a forward-looking predictive manner. These findings suggest that object representations in {MTL} come to mirror the temporal structure of the environment, supporting rapid and incidental statistical learning.},

	abstract = {Attention is a core cognitive mechanism that allows the brain to allocate limited resources depending on current task demands. A number of frontal and posterior parietal cortical areas, referred to collectively as the fronto-parietal attentional control network, are engaged during attentional allocation in both humans and non-human primates. Numerous studies have examined this network in the human brain using various neuroimaging and scalp electrophysiological techniques. However, little is known about how these frontal and parietal areas interact dynamically to produce behavior on a fine temporal (sub-second) and spatial (sub-centimeter) scale. We addressed how human fronto-parietal regions control visuospatial attention on a fine spatiotemporal scale by recording electrocorticography ({ECoG}) signals measured directly from subdural electrode arrays that were implanted in patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic foci. Subjects (n = 8) performed a spatial-cuing task, in which they allocated visuospatial attention to either the right or left visual field and detected the appearance of a target. We found increases in high gamma ({HG}) power (70-250 Hz) time-locked to trial onset that remained elevated throughout the attentional allocation period over frontal, parietal, and visual areas. These {HG} power increases were modulated by the phase of the ongoing delta/theta (2-5 Hz) oscillation during attentional allocation. Critically, we found that the strength of this delta/theta phase-{HG} amplitude coupling predicted reaction times to detected targets on a trial-by-trial basis. These results highlight the role of delta/theta phase-{HG} amplitude coupling as a mechanism for sub-second facilitation and coordination within human fronto-parietal cortex that is guided by momentary attentional demands.},

	abstract = {Recent models of human posterior parietal cortex ({PPC}) have variously emphasized its role in spatial perception, visuomotor control or directing attention. However, neuroimaging and lesion studies also suggest that the right {PPC} might play a special role in maintaining an alert state. Previously, assessments of right-hemisphere patients with hemispatial neglect have revealed significant overall deficits on vigilance tasks, but to date there has been no demonstration of a deterioration of performance over time--a vigilance decrement--considered by some to be a key index of a deficit in maintaining attention. Moreover, sustained attention deficits in neglect have not specifically been related to {PPC} lesions, and it remains unclear whether they interact with spatial impairments in this syndrome. Here we examined the ability of right-hemisphere patients with neglect to maintain attention, comparing them to stroke controls and healthy individuals. We found evidence of an overall deficit in sustaining attention associated with {PPC} lesions, even for a simple detection task with stimuli presented centrally. In a second experiment, we demonstrated a vigilance decrement in neglect patients specifically only when they were required to maintain attention to spatial locations, but not verbal material. Lesioned voxels in the right {PPC} spanning a region between the intraparietal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were significantly associated with this deficit. Finally, we compared performance on a task that required attention to be maintained either to visual patterns or spatial locations, matched for task difficulty. Again, we found a vigilance decrement but only when attention had to be maintained on spatial information. We conclude that sustaining attention to spatial locations is a critical function of the human right {PPC} which needs to be incorporated into models of normal parietal function as well as those of the clinical syndrome of hemispatial neglect.},

	abstract = {The formation of associations between items and their context has been proposed to rely on mechanisms distinct from those supporting memory for a single item. Although emotional experiences can profoundly affect memory, our understanding of how it interacts with different aspects of memory remains unclear. We performed three experiments to examine the effects of emotion on memory for items and their associations. By presenting neutral and negative items with background contexts, Experiment 1 demonstrated that item memory was facilitated by emotional affect, whereas memory for an associated context was reduced. In Experiment 2, arousal was manipulated independently of the memoranda, by a threat of shock, whereby encoding trials occurred under conditions of threat or safety. Memory for context was equally impaired by the presence of negative affect, whether induced by threat of shock or a negative item, relative to retrieval of the context of a neutral item in safety. In Experiment 3, participants were presented with neutral and negative items as paired associates, including all combinations of neutral and negative items. The results showed both above effects: compared to a neutral item, memory for the associate of a negative item (a second item here, context in Experiments 1 and 2) is impaired, whereas retrieval of the item itself is enhanced. Our findings suggest that negative affect impairs associative memory while recognition of a negative item is enhanced. They support dual-processing models in which negative affect or stress impairs hippocampal-dependent associative memory while the storage of negative sensory/perceptual representations is spared or even strengthened.},

Computational modeling based on neuronal firing patterns in animals suggests that one putative mechanism enabling working memory is periodic reactivation (henceforth termed "replay") of the maintained information coordinated by neural oscillations at theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency. To investigate this possibility, we trained multivariate pattern classifier decoding algorithms on oscillatory brain responses to images depicting natural scenes, recorded with high temporal resolution via magnetoencephalography. These classifiers were applied to brain activity recorded during the subsequent five second maintenance of the scenes. This decoding revealed replay during the entire maintenance interval. Replay was specific to whether an indoor or an outdoor scene was maintained and whether maintenance centered on configural associations of scene elements or just single scene elements. Replay was coordinated by the phase of theta and the amount of theta coordination was correlated with working memory performance. By confirming the predictions of a mechanistic model and linking these to behavioral performance in humans, these findings identify theta-coupled replay as a mechanism of working memory maintenance.},

	abstract = {Oscillatory activity is a widespread phenomenon in nervous systems and has been implicated in numerous functions. Signals that are generated by two separate neuronal sources often demonstrate a consistent phase-relationship in a particular frequency-band, i.e., they demonstrate rhythmic neuronal synchronization. This consistency is conventionally measured by the {PLV} (phase-locking value) or the spectral coherence measure. Both statistical measures suffer from significant bias, in that their sample estimates overestimate the population statistics for finite sample sizes. This is a significant problem in the neurosciences where statistical comparisons are often made between conditions with a different number of trials or between neurons with a different number of spikes. We introduce a new circular statistic, the {PPC} (pairwise phase consistency). We demonstrate that the sample estimate of the {PPC} is a bias-free and consistent estimator of its corresponding population parameter. We show, both analytically and by means of numerical simulations, that the population statistic of the {PPC} is equivalent to the population statistic of the squared {PLV}. The variance and mean squared error of the {PPC} and {PLV} are compared. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the method in actual neuronal data recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex of rats that engage in a two-odour discrimination task. We find a strong increase in rhythmic synchronization of spikes relative to the local field potential (as measured by the {PPC}) for a wide range of low frequencies (including the theta-band) during the anticipation of sucrose delivery in comparison to the anticipation of quinine delivery.},

The frontal theta enhancement was primarily evident in high performers on the order {WM} task, whereas the posterior alpha enhancement was primarily evident in high performers on the item {WM} task.

While previous research has emphasized the prominence of semantic organization, the present method illustrates the importance of association by contiguity. This is done by examining conditional response probabilities in the output sequence. For a given item recalled, I examine the probability and latency that it follows an item from a nearby or distant input position. These conditional probabilities and latencies, plotted as a function of the lag between studied items, reveal several regularities about output order in free recall. First, subjects tend to recall items more often and more rapidly from adjacent input positions than from remote input positions. Second, subjects are about twice as likely to recall adjacent pairs in the forward than in the backward direction and are significantly faster in doing so. These effects are observed at all positions in the output sequence. The asymmetry effect is theoretically significant because, in cued recall, nearly symmetric retrieval is found at all serial positions (Kahana, 1995; Murdock, 1962). An attempt is made to fit the search of associative memory model (Raaijmakers \& Shiffrin, 1980, 1981) with and without symmetric interitem associations to these data.

Semantic clustering is due to longstanding context-to-item associations, whereas temporal clustering and source clustering are both due to associations formed during the study episode. A behavioral investigation of the three forms of organization provides data to constrain the {CMR} model, revealing interactions between the organizational factors. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of {CMR} for their understanding of a broad class of episodic memory phenomena and suggest ways in which this theory may guide exploration of the neural correlates of memory search.},

	abstract = {Multivariate analysis is a very general and powerful technique for analysing Magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) data. An outstanding problem however is how to make inferences that are consistent over a group of subjects as to whether there are condition-specific differences in data features, and what are those features that maximise these differences. Here we propose a solution based on Canonical Variates Analysis ({CVA}) model scoring at the subject level and random effects Bayesian model selection at the group level. We apply this approach to beamformer reconstructed {MEG} data in source space. {CVA} estimates those multivariate patterns of activation that correlate most highly with the experimental design; the order of a {CVA} model is then determined by the number of significant canonical vectors. Random effects Bayesian model comparison then provides machinery for inferring the optimal order over the group of subjects. Absence of a multivariate dependence is indicated by the null model being the most likely. This approach can also be applied to {CVA} models with a fixed number of canonical vectors but supplied with different feature sets. We illustrate the method by identifying feature sets based on variable-dimension {MEG} power spectra in the primary visual cortex and fusiform gyrus that are maximally discriminative of data epochs before versus after visual stimulation.},

	abstract = {Theta and gamma frequency oscillations occur in the same brain regions and interact with each other, a process called cross-frequency coupling. Here, we review evidence for the following hypothesis: that the dual oscillations form a code for representing multiple items in an ordered way. This form of coding has been most clearly demonstrated in the hippocampus, where different spatial information is represented in different gamma subcycles of a theta cycle. Other experiments have tested the functional importance of oscillations and their coupling. These involve correlation of oscillatory properties with memory states, correlation with memory performance, and effects of disrupting oscillations on memory. Recent work suggests that this coding scheme coordinates communication between brain regions and is involved in sensory as well as memory processes.},

	abstract = {These experiments investigate people's knowledge of routine activities (e.g., eating in a restaurant, visiting a dentist) and how that knowledge is organized and used to understand and remember narrative texts. We use the term script to refer to these action stereotypes. Two studies collected script norms: people described what goes on in detail during familiar activities. They largely agreed on the nature of the characters, props, actions, and the order of the actions. They also agreed on how to segment the low-level action sequences into constituent “scenes,” suggesting a hierarchical organization in memory of the activity. Other studies investigated memory for a text narrating actions from a script. Subjects tended to confuse in memory actions that were stated with unstated actions implied by the script. This tendency increased as more related script instances were studied. Subjects also preferred to recall script actions in their familiar order; a scrambled text that presented some script actions out of order tended to be recalled in canonical order. We also investigated whether the reading time for adjacent statements in a text varied with their distance apart in the underlying script. A statement at a one-step distance was read faster than one at a two- or three-step distance; statements in the second half of a script were read faster than those in the first half. A final experiment found that goal-relevant deviations from a script were remembered better than script actions. The role of script knowledge in text memory was discussed, as was the relation of scripts to schema memory in general.},

	abstract = {A fundamental goal in memory research is to understand how information is represented in distributed brain networks and what mechanisms enable its reactivation. It is evident that progress towards this goal will greatly benefit from multivariate pattern classification ({MVPC}) techniques that can decode representations in brain activity with high temporal resolution. Recently, progress along these lines has been achieved by applying {MVPC} to neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography ({EEG}) and magnetoencephalography ({MEG}). We highlight two examples of methodological approaches for {MVPC} of {EEG} and {MEG} data that can be used to study memory function. The first example aims at understanding the dynamic neural mechanisms that enable reactivation of memory representations, i.e., memory replay; we discuss how {MVPC} can help uncover the physiological mechanisms underlying memory replay during working memory maintenance and episodic memory. The second example aims at understanding representational differences between various types of memory, such as perceptual priming and conscious recognition memory. We also highlight the conceptual and methodological differences between these two examples. Finally, we discuss potential future applications for {MVPC} of {EEG}/{MEG} data in studies of memory. We conclude that despite its infancy and existing methodological challenges, {MVPC} of {EEG} and {MEG} data is a powerful tool with which to assess mechanistic models of memory.},
