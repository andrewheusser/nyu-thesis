# A segmented stream of consciousness

\begin{quote}
\textit{"Consciousness, then, does not appear to itself chopped up in bits. Such words as 'chain' or 'train' do not describe it fitly as it presents itself in the first instance. It is nothing jointed; if flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life..."}
\end{quote}

This famous passage by William James from his book \textit{The Principles of Psychology} is frequently used to describe the continuous and flowing nature of our conscious experiences. It perfectly captures the intuition that our life experiences ebb and flow like a river, without noticeable breaks or disruptions. The passage is usually cut off at this point, leading the reader to believe that James actually thought of consciousness as a flowing undivided river of experience.  Ironically, the next line is hardly ever included in the passage, and virtually contradicts the message that comes before it:

\begin{quote}
\textit{"...But now there appears, even within the limits of the same self, and between thoughts all of which alike have this same sense of belonging together, a kind of jointing and separateness among the parts, of which this statement seems to take no account.  I refer to the breaks that are produced by sudden contrasts in the quality of the successive segments of the stream of thought. If the words 'chain' and 'train' had no natural fitness in them, how came such words to be used at all? Does not a loud explosion rend the consciousness upon which it abruptly breaks, in twain? Does not every sudden shock, appearance of a new object, or change in a sensation, create a real interruption, sensibly felt as such, which cuts the conscious stream across at the moment at which it appears? Do not such interruptions smite us every hour of our lives, and have we the right, in their presence, still to call our consciousness a continuous stream?"}
\end{quote}

Considering the passage in its entirety, it is clear that James did view consciousness as a stream, but also recognized that sudden contrasts and novel events in our experiences can create discontinuities in the stream.  Unfortunately, however, the early part of the passage is almost always taken out of context, which not only obscures the point James was trying to make, but also devalues the fact that sudden contrasts are frequent in our daily lives and may help to parse the overwhelming amounts of perceptual information we digest at any given moment into more coherent and manageable units. In other words, the \textit{stream} won the popularity context, and the \textit{contrasts} got the short end of the stick\footnote{Thank you to Dr. Jeff Zacks for pointing this out in his talk at the Context and Episodic Memory Symposium in 2016.}.

When we reflect back on our experiences through memory, it is not as if the floodgates open and out pours all of our sensory/perceptual experiences like a firehose (or a stream).  Rather, memories are echoes of an experience, and are more akin to mnemonic summaries that are organized with respect to correlated features in the environment, such as the spatial and temporal context in which the events occurred [@tulving_organization_1995].  The broad question in my research and the topic of this thesis is: how does the brain segment and structure our continuous experiences into mnemonic events?

# The dissertation roadmap

In Chapter 1, I will present a series of three behavioral studies aimed to answer the question: how do sudden contrasts or \textit{boundaries} in our perceptual experiences impose structure on our memories for those events? Said another way, how do contextual features that span over multiple contiguous items influence their organization in memory? In each of these three studies, participants are presented with trains of trial-unique items that share a perceptual feature (i.e. the background color).  We then test various forms of episodic memory to assess how the 'event' structure of the task influences the mnemonic organization of the items.

In Chapters 2 and 3, I investigate how rhythmic brain activity during structured encoding experiences relates to memory organization.  In Chapter 2, I focus on the neuhow rhythmic brain activity


# Neural oscillations

Neural oscillations can be defined as rhythmic cycles of neuronal excitability. Originally discovered by @berger_uber_1929, the study of neural oscillations has amassed a wealth of attention and research over recent years [@buzsaki_neuronal_2004].  This rhythmic brain activity is predominant the .5-500 Hz range in the mammalian brain [ref], and this is highly conserved across species [ref]. While still debated [ref], recent theories suggest that oscillations play an active role in information representation and in human cognition more broadly [@buzsaki_neuronal_2004].  In fact oscillatory neural activity has been related to nearly all subdivisions in the field of cognitive neuroscience: visual and auditory perception, attention, language, working memory and long-term memory.  It is thought that neural oscillations are critical for these mental processes because they represent precisely-timed firing patterns of large populations of neurons in distributed neural networks. Furthermore, oscillations are thought to provide a temporal window for the integration of information represented in distinct neural cell assemblies, often in different locations throughout the brain that fire at different points in time.  Perhaps then, it is not surprising that oscillations are associated with so many cognitive phenomena, as all complex cognitive operations require the coordination and integration of information over multiple populations of neurons.  

Over the course of a few decades of empirical research on neural oscillations, the frequency spectrum of mammalian brain oscillations (i.e. roughly .5 Hz to 500 Hz) has been subdivided into distinct categories by the fact that they tend to cluster into several distinct bands.  Intriguingly, these subdivisions roughly appear to form a linear progression when plotted on a logarithmic scale [ADD THIS REF; see figure 1b in @buzsaki_neuronal_2004].  The bands most commonly studied and cited in the human cognitive literature are delta (1-3 Hz), theta (3/4-8 Hz), alpha (9-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz) and will be the focus of the current work. These distinct bands represent fluctuations in neuronal activity at different temporal rates.  For instance, theta oscillations fluctuate at a relatively slower rate of 3 or 4 to 8 or 9 cycles per second (depending on who you ask), while gamma rhythms oscillate at a much faster rate of greater than 30 cycles per second.  Broadly speaking, slower oscillations are thought to integrate information over longer temporal and spatial scales while higher oscillations are thought to represent more local information processing [ref].  

While a deep treatment of the neuroscience behind brain oscillations is out of the scope of this thesis, in the following paragraphs, I will briefly summarize what is currently known about about the functional properties of neural oscillations with respect to working memory, long-term memory, and temporal sequence representation, as these cognitive subdivisions are all likely at play in the experiments that I will present here. I will also focus more on theta and gamma oscillations, as those frequency bands have been most reliably linked with episodic memory in the literature.

## Working memory

Several studies in humans have observed that power in the theta band during a delay period covaries with working memory (WM) load [@jensen_frontal_2002; @raghavachari_gating_2001;  @raghavachari_theta_2006; @hsieh_neural_2011; @scheeringa_trial-by-trial_2009; @gevins_high-resolution_1997].  To test for load-dependent power modulation, studies have typically presented a variable number of items to participants and have recorded M/EEG or iEEG during a delay period when the participant is presumably maintaining the studied items.  Interestingly, @hsieh_neural_2011 found that theta power over frontal electrodes is relatively greater during the maintenance of temporal information relative to the maintenance of items alone.  They speculated that frontal theta power might represent prefrontal cortex (PFC) control related processes that support the maintenance of associative information [@blumenfeld_putting_2011].  Consistent with the role of prefrontal theta oscillations in working memory, @siegel_phase-dependent_2009 found that neuronal spiking in the PFC during a working memory delay period was phase-locked to an underlying theta/delta oscillation in monkeys. Thus, frontally distributed theta power appears to be related to working memory, but the mechanism remains unclear.  Theta oscillations are prominent in the hippocampus [@buzsaki_theta_2002; @ekstrom_human_2005], which has led some to speculate that the hippocampus might drive prefrontal theta oscillations and coordinate interactions between the two regions [@anderson_theta_2010]. Indeed, there is emerging evidence in rodents for a frontal-hippocampal bidirectional regime of this nature [@place_bidirectional_2016].

Gamma power has also been shown to play a role in working memory and covary with WM load [@howard_gamma_2003; @roux_gamma-band_2012; @van_vugt_hippocampal_2010]. These load modulated effects do not appear to be anatomically specific, as they have been observed in the hippocampus [@van_vugt_hippocampal_2010], in frontoparietal networks [@roux_gamma-band_2012], as well as distributed across the cortex [@howard_gamma_2003].

## Long-term episodic memory

Theta oscillations have also been implicated in the formation [@guderian_medial_2009; @fell_medial_2011; @sederberg_theta_2003; @friese_successful_2013; @summerfield_coherent_2005; @staudigl_theta_2013; @white_theta_2013; @pastotter_distinct_2014; @osipova_theta_2006; @hanslmayr_relationship_2011]  and retrieval [@jacobs_eeg_2006; @addante_prestimulus_2011; @osipova_theta_2006; @bastiaansen_i_2008; @watrous_frequency-specific_2013] of long-term episodic memories.  In humans, hippocampal theta power preceding the encoding of an event is predictive of later memory success [@guderian_medial_2009; @fell_medial_2011; @sederberg_theta_2003].  Similarly, pre-stimulus theta power during retrieval has also been linked to the successful recovery of contextual detail (relative to item memory alone) [@addante_prestimulus_2011; but see @merkow_prestimulus_2014].  The fact that the activity preceded successful encoding/retrieval argues that theta power in these studies may index a mnemonic state that is optimal for memory processes.  Other work suggests that theta power may more specifically represent binding between an item and its associated context.  @summerfield_coherent_2005 found increased theta power and coherence at the scalp when a word and its associated color were successfully encoded (relative to trials where only the word was remembered).  Using a clever manipulation of encoding-test overlap, @staudigl_theta_2013 found that theta power was predictive of successful word encoding only in cases when the same background video clip was presented with the word at retrieval (i.e. the match condition).  Intriguingly, if at retrieval the word was paired with a different video clip (the mismatch condition), relatively lower theta power predicted item memory success.  This finding suggests that memory-related theta oscillations may play a specific role in associative binding, rather than representing a more general memory strength process.  Interestingly, other reports have observed both decreases and increases in theta power during encoding is predictive of successful free recall [@long_subsequent_2014; @burke_synchronous_2013; @greenberg_decreases_2015; @pastotter_distinct_2014].  Together with the findings from @staudigl_theta_2013, these findings suggest that increases in theta power may not be a direct proxy for 'good' memory encoding, but rather relative increases/decreases may depend on the particular encoding task and the type of memory that is being probed.

While the relationship between theta oscillations and episodic memory remains somewhat controversial, increases in gamma power during encoding have been more consistently linked to successful memory formation [@van_gerven_decoding_2013; @sederberg_theta_2003; @osipova_theta_2006; @long_subsequent_2014; @burke_synchronous_2013; @greenberg_decreases_2015; @sederberg_hippocampal_2007] and retrieval [@osipova_theta_2006] in both hippocampus and cortical areas.  In monkeys, [@jutras] found that gamma power and gamma spike field coherence in the hippocampus was related to successful encoding.


## Theta-gamma coupling and a model of sequence encoding

While a great deal has been learned about how the brain supports episodic memory for individual elements within an experience [REFS] as well as neural oscillations support single event encoding, relatively less is known about how the brain supports memory for experiences that are extended in time.  Representing dynamic and temporally-extended experiences requires a neural mechanism that is capable of linking distinct cell assemblies that may not be active at the same time. Importantly, this mechanism must also be able to encode the relative order of information, as relative order is a fundamental property of an temporally-extended episodic memory.  For example, remembering a telephone number requires not only a representation of the numbers themselves, but also the order in which they were presented.  One prominent mechanistic model for how this is implemented in the brain hypothesizes that the contents, or the individual items within an experience, are represented in largely non overlapping cell assemblies firing in the gamma band, while the relative sequential order of the items is coded along the phase of an underlying theta wave [@lisman_storage_1995; @jensen_theta/gamma_1996].  The model was originally designed to explain how multi-item messages might be maintained in working memory, but has been extended to long-term memory as well as proposed to be a more neural mechanism for information processing [@lisman_theta/gamma_2005]. Theoretically, phase coding allows the temporal segregation of activity supporting individual items that are encountered at different times across an experience, and critically may also permit temporally extended experiences to be represented in a time-compressed manner [@jensen_physiologically_1996] (~100-300 ms cycles of neuronal activity).  Furthermore, this time scale would allow for neurons to be linked via long-term potentiation [@bliss_long-lasting_1973], which has been recently shown to support associative memory formation @nabavi_engineering_2014].

In humans, there is evidence for memory-related hippocampal theta-gamma coupling [@axmacher_cross-frequency_2010; @mormann_phase/amplitude_2005; @tort_thetagamma_2009; @lega_slow-theta--gamma_2014; @staudigl_theta_2013] and in cortical regions [@canolty_high_2006; @lee_electrical_2013; @maris_spatially_2011].  One study found that during a working memory delay, encoding-related gamma patterns were reactivated in a periodic manner that was phase locked to a theta oscillation [@fuentemilla_theta-coupled_2010].  Interestingly, [@jacobs_neural_2009] found that while viewing of individual letters during a working memory task, high gamma power (65-128 Hz) was biased toward distinct phases of theta for different letters, and this pattern was most prevalant in occipital cortex.  Finally, [@friese_successful_2013] found that coupling between frontal theta and posterior gamma was predictive of subsequent memory.  Given these results, it is clear that theta-gamma coupling plays a role in memory encoding. However, an outstanding question is whether theta phase coded gamma representations can support memory for the sequence, a critical prediction of the theta-gamma model.

## Theta sweeps and hippocampal replay

In rodents, there is strong evidence for theta phase coding in the hippocampus [@okeefe_hippocampus_1971; @dragoi_temporal_2006; @foster_hippocampal_2007; @johnson_neural_2007].  During navigation, place cells [@okeefe_hippocampus_1971] representing contiguous points in a spatial environment fire in succession, and are locked to the phase of an underlying theta oscillation.  These experience-dependent firing patterns, coined hippocampal theta 'sweeps' [@gupta_segmentation_2012; @foster_hippocampal_2007; @johnson_neural_2007], occur during navigation, during offline rest periods, and are also involved in planning [@wikenheiser_hippocampal_2015].  In one interesting line of work, one lab has demonstrated that theta sweeps can represent upcoming spatial locations [@johnson_neural_2007] ...  Together, these findings suggest that theta-locked replay may be a mechanism by which the hippocampus codes spatiotemporal trajectories, or in other words, sequences of spatial representations.
