\textit{"Consciousness, then, does not appear to itself chopped up in bits. Such words as 'chain' or 'train' do not describe it fitly as it presents itself in the first instance. It is nothing jointed; if flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life..."}
\end{quote}

This famous passage by William James from his book \textit{The Principles of Psychology} is frequently used to describe the continuous and flowing nature of our conscious experiences. It perfectly captures the intuition that our life experiences ebb and flow like a river, without noticeable breaks or disruptions. The passage is usually cut off at this point, leading the reader to believe that James actually thought of consciousness as a flowing undivided river of experience.  Ironically, the next line\footnote{literally, the very next line - Thank you to Dr. Jeff Zacks for pointing this out in his talk at the Context and Episodic Memory Symposium in 2016} is hardly ever included in the passage, and virtually contradicts the message that comes before it:

\begin{quote}
\textit{...But now there appears, even within the limits of the same self, and between thoughts all of which alike have this same sense of belonging together, a kind of jointing and separateness among the parts, of which this statement seems to take no account.  I refer to the breaks that are produced by sudden contrasts in the quality of the successive segments of the stream of thought. If the words 'chain' and 'train' had no natural fitness in them, how came such words to be used at all? Does not a loud explosion rend the consciousness upon which it abruptly breaks, in twain? Does not every sudden shock, appearance of a new object, or change in a sensation, create a real interruption, sensibly felt as such, which cuts the conscious stream across at the moment at which it appears? Do not such interruptions smite us every hour of our lives, and have we the right, in their presence, still to call our consciousness a continuous stream?}
\end{quote}

Considering the passage in its entirety, it is clear that James did view consciousness as a stream, but also recognized that sudden contrasts and novel events in our experiences can create discontinuities in the stream.  Unfortunately, however, the early part of the passage is almost always taken out of context, which not only obscures the point James was trying to make, but also devalues the fact that sudden contrasts are frequent in our daily lives and may help to parse the overwhelming amounts of perceptual information we digest at any given moment into more coherent and manageable units. In other words, the \textit{stream} won the popularity context, and the \textit{contrasts} got the short end of the stick.

When we reflect back on our experiences through memory, it is not as if the floodgates open and out pours all of our sensory/perceptual experiences like a firehose (or a stream).  Rather, memories are echoes of an experience, they are highly structured [refs] and are more akin to mnemonic summaries that are organized with respect to correlated features in the environment, such as the spatial and temporal context in which the events occurred [@tulving_organization_1995].

While sudden contrasts are by definition changes that are fleeting, they impose long lasting structure onto our memories for those experiences.

Chapter 1 of this thesis aims to answer the question: 1) how do sudden contrasts or boundaries in our perceptual experiences structure our memories for those events?

## Neural oscillations

Neural oscillations can be defined as rhythmic cycles of neuronal excitability. Originally discovered by Hans Berger in 1929 [@berger FIND THIS REF], the study of neural oscillations has amassed a wealth of attention and research over recent years [@buzsaki_neuronal_2004].  This rhythmic brain activity is predominant the .5-500 Hz range in the mammalian brain [ref], and this is highly conserved across species [ref]. While still debated [ref], recent theories suggest that oscillations play an active role in information representation and in human cognition more broadly [@buzsaki_neuronal_2004].  In fact oscillatory neural activity has been related to nearly all subdivisions in the field of cognitive neuroscience: visual and auditory perception, attention, language, working memory and long-term memory.  It is thought that neural oscillations are critical for these mental processes because they represent precisely-timed firing patterns of large populations of neurons in distributed neural networks. Furthermore, oscillations are thought to provide a temporal window for the integration of information represented in distinct neural cell assemblies, often in different locations throughout the brain that fire at different points in time.  Perhaps then, it is not surprising that oscillations are associated with so many cognitive phenomena, as all complex cognitive operations require the coordination and integration of information over multiple populations of neurons.  

Over the course of a few decades of empirical research on neural oscillations, the frequency spectrum of mammalian brain oscillations (i.e. roughly .5 Hz to 500 Hz) has been subdivided into distinct categories by the fact that they tend to cluster into several distinct bands.  Intriguingly, these subdivisions roughly appear to form a linear progression when plotted on a logarithmic scale [ADD THIS REF; see figure 1b in @buzsaki_neuronal_2004].  The bands most commonly studied and cited in the human cognitive literature are delta (1-3 Hz), theta (3/4-8 Hz), alpha (9-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz) and will be the focus of the current work. These distinct bands represent fluctuations in neuronal activity at different temporal rates.  For instance, theta oscillations fluctuate at a relatively slower rate of 3 or 4 to 8 or 9 cycles per second (depending on who you ask), while gamma rhythms oscillate at a much faster rate of greater than 30 cycles per second.  Broadly speaking, slower oscillations are thought to integrate information over longer temporal and spatial scales while higher oscillations are thought to represent more local information processing [ref].  

While a deep treatment of the neuroscience behind brain oscillations is out of the scope of this thesis, in the following paragraphs, I will briefly summarize what is currently known about about the functional properties of neural oscillations with respect to working memory, long-term memory, and temporal sequence representation, as these cognitive subdivisions are all likely at play in the experiments that I will present here. I will also focus more on theta and gamma oscillations, as those frequency bands have been most reliably linked with episodic memory in the literature.

### Working memory

Several studies in humans have observed that power in the theta band during a delay period covaries with working memory load [@jensen_frontal_2002; @raghavachari_gating_2001 @raghavachari_theta_2006; @hsieh_neural_2011; @scheeringa_trial-by-trial_2009; @gevins_high-resolution_1997].  To test for load-dependent power modulation, studies have typically presented a variable number of items to participants and have recorded M/EEG or iEEG during a delay period when the participant is presumably maintaining the studied items.  Interestingly, @hsieh_neural_2011 found that theta power over frontal electrodes is relatively greater during the maintenance of temporal information relative to the maintenance of items alone.  They speculated that frontal theta power might represent prefrontal cortex (PFC) control related processes that support the maintenance of associative information [@blumenfeld_putting_2011].  Consistent with the role of prefrontal theta oscillations in working memory, @siegel_phase-dependent_2009 found that neuronal spiking in the PFC during a working memory delay period was phase-locked to an underlying theta/delta oscillation in monkeys. Thus, frontally distributed theta power appears to be related to working memory, but the mechanism remains unclear.  Theta oscillations are prominent in the hippocampus [@buzsaki 2002 REF; @Ekstrom 2005 REF], which has led some to speculate that the hippocampus might drive prefrontal theta oscillations [anderson 2010], and coordinate interactions between the two regions [refs].  Given that there are relatively unidirectional connections from hippocampus to the prefrontal cortex, this regime is a definitely possibility.

Gamma power has also been shown to play a role in working memory and covary with working memory load

### Long-term memory



### Theta oscillations, theta-gamma coupling and memory for sequences

While a great deal has been learned about how the brain supports episodic memory for individual elements within an experience [REFS], relatively less is known about how the brain supports memory for experiences that are extended in time.  Representing dynamic and temporally-extended experiences requires a neural mechanism that is capable of linking distinct cell assemblies that may not be active at the same time. Importantly, this mechanism must also be able to encode the relative order of information, as temporal order is a fundamental property of an temporally-extended episodic memory.  For example, remembering a telephone number requires not only a representation of the numbers themselves, but also the order in which they were presented.
