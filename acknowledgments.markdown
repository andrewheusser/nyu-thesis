I thank my advisor, Professor Lila Davachi, for her support and guidance.  My committee members (present and past), Professors David Poeppel, Jon Winawer, and Brice Kuhl for their advice and support over the years.  My collaborators Dr. Youssef Ezzyat, Dr. Vishnu Murty and Marika Inhoff, who helped me grow scientifically and personally. My cohort - especially Teon Brooks and Karolina Lempert - for many years of support and good times. To my family, for helping us stay afloat, both emotionally and financially.  Finally, thank you to the Davachi lab, for years and years of fun, incredible support and excellent scientific feedback that had an enormous impact on this work.
