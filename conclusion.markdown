# Fitting it all together: a model of oscillations and event formation

To integrate the findings presented here, below I propose a model of how distinct brain regions with oscillatory neural mechanisms might support the encoding of temporally extended and sequential events. This model will help to integrate findings across the three chapters, as well as make predictions for future research.

In the first chapter, we found behavioral evidence that temporal order memory for stimuli that were encountered within the same event was relatively better than temporal memory for across-event pairs of trials. One explanation for these findings is that as the brain encounters adjacent stimuli perceived to be in the same event, an event model [@zacks_event_2001; @kurby_segmentation_2008] is maintained which could facilitate the associative binding of those items [@dubrow_temporal_2014; @davachi_how_2015; @dubrow_influence_2013]. The outcome of this would would be relatively stronger binding for within-event vs. across event items, which could in turn facilitate the retrieval of temporal relationships during a subsequent temporal order test [@davachi_how_2015; @dubrow_temporal_2014]. The findings reported in Chapter 3 are consistent with the idea that within-event items may be associative linked and temporally ordered via a hippocampal theta-gamma phase coding mechanism.  Thus, if items are perceived to be in the same event, their distinct neural representations (coded in gamma power) could be phase coded by an underlying theta oscillation, and associatively linked via long term potentiation [@bliss_long-lasting_1973; @nabavi_engineering_2014].

Based on our finding that beta power (source localized to frontoparietal regions) accumulates within an event and drops sharply at event boundaries, its plausible that beta oscillations in frontoparietal networks might index top-down endogenous processes involved in the maintenance of an event model.  It has been suggested that in tasks requiring high levels of endogenous control, beta oscillations might index the maintenance of the 'status quo' [@engel_beta-band_2010].  Increases in frontoparietal beta oscillations could be an index of top down maintenance [@buschman_top-down_2007], while decreases could be related to the bottom up processing of novel information [@hanslmayr_oscillations_2016]. Thus, the temporal dynamics in beta power that we observed in Chapter 2, could correlate with the extent to which the brain was in a maintenance vs. novel processing state.

If this model is accurate, frontoparietal beta and hippocampal theta-gamma coupling should be related: when beta power is high (and the system is maintaining the status quo), theta-gamma phase coding should also be strong.  In other words, if increases in frontoparietal beta power can be taken as a proxy for event model maintenance, then items being studied within that event model might be associatively bound together via a hippocampal theta-gamma phase coding.  This could be tested with an experiment that manipulates the presence of a coherent event model and tests whether this changes the relationship between frontoparietal beta power and hippocampal theta-gamma phase coding.

An unresolved question is where in the brain the event model is actually represented. While frontoparietal networks appear to be involved in the maintenance of the event model, it unlikely that the network represents the contents of the model directly.  One candidate region is the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which has been implicated in schema representation [@hyman_contextual_2012; @van_kesteren_how_2012]. A schema can be broadly defined as prior knowledge that influences current processing and an event model is a type of schema.  Thus, its possible that the mPFC might represent the contents of the event model.  If that is the case, then mPFC activity should also have bearing on hippocampal theta-gamma phase coding in scenarios where an event model is guiding new encoding.

# Future directions

One obvious follow up to this work is to characterize the bounds of the theta-gamma phase coding results.  While our effects appeared to localize to the left hippocampus, given the difficulty in deep source localization, we plan to replicate and extend this work with convergent methods with better spatial resolution.  To this end, we've begun collecting data on a variant of theta MEG experiment that was optimized for intracranial data collection. In this version of the task, we present a single event at a time (6 objects) with a 5 second delay and a temporal order memory test trial. So far, we have one intracranial subject with bilateral anterior and posterior hippocampal electrodes.  As a first pass, we performed the same exact theta-gamma phase coding by sequence position analysis that was performed on the MEG data.  Remarkably, in the left posterior hippocampus we also see that items in distinct sequence positions are biased toward distinct phases of theta (Figure 3.18). We plan to continue data collection on this project.

Another question to follow up on is whether the event model can be localized to a particular brain region.  In the current set of experiments, an event model is present at all times during encoding.  In future extensions of this work, we hope to manipulate the availability of an event model to test 1) whether the presence of an event model facilitates encoding and subsequent memory 2) what brain areas are involved in representing the event model.  Given prior work, the mPFC may play a role in representing the event model [see @preston_interplay_2013 for review], but future studies will investigate this possibility directly.

In this series of experiments, the timing and the structure of the events and the stimuli were perfectly predictable and participants in our studies were instructed with a particular task. The real world is not nearly this structured and predictable  Thus, one challenge and question for future research is to ask whether this model can account for situations more analogous to real life, where the stimuli and timing in the environment are only probabilistically predictable.  For instance, one could imagine designing a study where the stability of the task structure was probabilistic and evolving, and ask whether the power accumulation and theta-gamma phase coding effects were still present.
