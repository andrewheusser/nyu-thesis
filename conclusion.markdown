# Fitting it all together: a model of mnemonic event formation

To integrate the findings presented here, I propose a model of how distinct brain regions with oscillatory neural mechanisms might support the encoding of temporally extended and sequential events. This model, described below, will help to integrate findings across the three chapters, as well as make predictions for future research.

In the first chapter, we found behavioral evidence that temporal order memory for stimuli that were encountered within the same event was relatively better than temporal memory for across-event pairs of trials. One explanation for these findings is that as the brain encounters adjacent stimuli perceived to be in the same event, an event model [@zacks_event_2001; @kurby_segmentation_2008] is maintained which could facilitate the associative binding of those items [@dubrow_temporal_2014; @davachi_how_2015; @dubrow_influence_2013]. Strong associative links among within event items could in turn facilitate the retrieval of temporal relationships during a subsequent test[@davachi_how_2015; @dubrow_temporal_2014]. Based on the findings reported in the third chapter, it's possible that within-event items could be associative linked and temporally ordered via a hippocampal theta-gamma coding mechanism.  Thus, if items are perceived to be in the same event, their neural representations (coded in gamma power) could be phase coded by an underlying theta oscillation, and associatively linked via long term potentiation [@bliss_long-lasting_1973; @nabavi_engineering_2014].  One prediction of this is that during temporal order retrieval, items that intervened the test items during encoding may be rapidly replayed, and that event boundaries might break the associative chain. There is evidence for reactivation of intervening items during temporal order retrieval [@dubrow_temporal_2014], and using M/EEG or iEEG one could test whether the reactivation during retrieval is phase coded by theta.

Based on our finding that beta power (source localized to frontoparietal regions) accumulates within an event and drops sharply at event boundaries, its plausible that beta oscillations in frontoparietal networks might index top-down endogenous processes involved in the maintenance of an event model.  It has been suggested that in tasks requiring high levels of endogenous control, beta oscillations might index the maintenance of the 'status quo' [@engel_beta-band_2010].  Thus, increases in frontoparietal beta oscillations could be an index of top down maintenance [@buschman_top-down_2007], while decreases could be related to the bottom up processing of novel information.

One prediction of this model is that frontoparietal beta and hippocampal theta-gamma coupling should be related: when beta power is high (and the system is maintaining the status quo), theta-gamma phase coding should also be strong.  In other words, if increases in frontoparietal beta power can be taken as a proxy for event model maintenance, then items being studied within that event model might be associatively bound together via a hippocampally-mediated theta-gamma phase coding mechanism.

Delta/Theta power also accumulated within an event, and source localized to the medial temporal lobes.
