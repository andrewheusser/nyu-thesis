# Introduction

Our experience of the world can be described as a continuous stream of sensory information that flows from the external environment into our brains through our sensory systems. However, empirical studies suggest that our memories for such experiences are organized according to contextual features such as perceptual, semantic, temporal and spatial similarities among the elements of an experience.  How do our brains distill our rich, continuous perceptual experience into meaningful and manageable units in memory?  This question is complex and difficult to approach because this process likely requires a coordinated interaction between perception, attention, working memory and long-term memory processes. While a great deal has been revealed about the neural systems and processes that contribute to memory formation for individual items and their associated contexts (refs), the cognitive and neural mechanisms associated with parsing experience into ‘mnemonic events’ has yet to be fully explored.
Event segmentation theory (EST), a computational/theoretical model of how the brain parses ongoing experience into events, posits that during perception the human brain maintains an ‘event model’. An event model can be defined as a working memory representation of ‘what is happening now’ [@kurby_segmentation_2008]. Event models are thought to contain contextually relevant details of an ongoing experience in order to generate predictions about future sensory input, which is an advantageous to an organism in a dangerous and uncertain world.  When there is a substantive change in the perceptual experience (for example, walking through a door way out of one room and into another) or predictability breaks down, EST suggests that the previous event model is abandoned (or perhaps, flushed from working memory) and a new event model is generated.  This process (known as ‘event segmentation’) is thought to help organize our experience into meaningful units by integrating information that is perceived to be in the same event, while keeping across-event information separate.  

Emerging evidence suggests that one consequence of event segmentation is that associative memory for information encoded in distinct events is reduced relative to information encountered in the same event [@ezzyat_what_2011; @dubrow_influence_2013].  In these studies, events are operationalized as temporally adjacent items with overlapping contextual features. @ezzyat_what_2011 found that cued recall performance is reduced for pairs of items that spanned a contextual shift (or an ‘event boundary’), and temporal order memory for across-boundary information is also reduced [@dubrow_influence_2013].  According to event segmentation theory,  this may occur because the online maintenance of an event model facilitates the integration of within-event information, and event boundaries disrupt integration processes. Bolstered by predictions from EST, these results suggest the existence of a neural mechanism whereby items are maintained and integrated within an event, but not across separate events.

In a separate literature, a number of studies have provided evidence that sustained and synchronized neural activity (i.e. neural oscillations) support the maintenance of information in working memory [@jensen_frontal_2002; @raghavachari_gating_2001; @hsieh_neural_2011].  Low frequency oscillatory power (i.e. Theta: 4-8 Hz) during a working memory delay period has been shown to increase with the number of items in working memory (citations), and the duration of the increase scales with the length of the delay period (citations).  Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that maintenance-related increases in theta power appear to be specifically related to working memory for temporal relationships among items, as opposed to the items themselves [@hsieh_neural_2011].  Thus, theta power increases appear not only to track the amount of information in working memory, but seems to be most strongly associated with the maintenance of the associative relationships among items.   

Theta oscillations have also been linked to the successful long-term memory encoding (citations) as well as retrieval (citations).  Numerous studies have found increased theta power for items that are subsequently remembered as compared to items that are later forgotten (citations, but see Long et al). Furthermore, a subset of these studies suggest that theta oscillations are involved in the binding between an item and its context (i.e. a word seen in a particular color), rather than indexing memory for an item alone [@summerfield_coherent_2005; @staudigl_theta_2013].  Taken together, these data suggest that memory-related theta oscillations may play a more general role in mnemonic binding or integration, whether it’s an item to its context or an item to another item.

The relationship between lower frequency oscillations and memory has been studied extensively.  Perhaps not surprisingly, most other frequency bands have also been linked to mnemonic processes in various experimental designs (citations). The frequency band that has received probably the least amount of attention with respect to memory is the beta (13-30 Hz) band.  However, there is also some theoretical work suggesting that beta oscillations may play a role in the maintenance of cognitive states (for review, see Engel and Fries). While the majority of this evidence comes from studies involving the maintenance of motor postures (i.e. holding an arm in a particular posture) and/or motor plans, a few studies suggest beta may be important for the maintenance of mnemonic information (talon bauldtry papers) as well as the maintenance of an attentional state (buschman and miller).  One recent study found that when recording from the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing a 2-item order maintenance task, beta oscillations increased during the delay period and beta phase was related to subsequent temporal order memory success. Thus, beta oscillations may also be involved mnemonic processes and play a particular role in the maintenance of a cognitive state or ‘event model’ (Engel and Fries).

In this study, we utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) to ask whether dynamics in oscillatory power might support the formation of episodic events.  Previous electrophysiological studies of memory have focused on within-trial spectral and temporal dynamics to examine the time course of memory-related oscillatory processes. However, relatively fewer studies have considered the modulation of oscillatory power at longer timescales (> 5 seconds).  In this study, we focused our analyses on across-trial changes in power to investigate how slower fluctuations in oscillatory power are modulated by the event structure in our paradigm and are related to the successful encoding of episodic events.  Guided by models of event segmentation and strong evidence in support of a relationship between neural oscillations and memory, we hypothesized that oscillatory power in the theta and beta band would increase within an event as more information is accumulated and integrated into the event model.  At event boundaries, we predicted that power would drop significantly as within-event representations might be flushed from working memory.  Finally, we hypothesized that within-event power accumulation would be related to temporal order memory on a later test.  Specifically, we predicted that successful within-event integration would be associated with a monotonic increase in power within an event that might index accumulating within-event information.

# Methods

### Participants

Twenty healthy native English speakers (XX males, age range: XX) were recruited from New York University and the greater New York Metropolitan area participated in the MEG experiment.  All participants gave informed written consent in accordance with the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (UCAIHS).  We excluded one subject for chance performance on the order memory test and one subject did not complete the study due to drowsiness.  We excluded these participants, leaving 18 subjects for the remaining MEG analyses.

### Materials

Details for this experiment are published in Heusser et al., 20XX.  The experimental design is identical to Experiment 2 in that manuscript.  Briefly, stimuli consisted of 576 gray-scale pictures of objects collected from various online sources.  Colored borders for the objects were generated by selecting 24 unique colors from a color continuum ranging from [0,0,0] to [255,255,255] RGB values.  Colors were chosen to be maximally distinct from each other. Within the experiment, the order of the stimuli varied for each subject and color-stimulus pairings were randomized across subject.

### Encoding  

During encoding, participants made pleasant/unpleasant decisions on trial-unique objects that were paired with a colored background frame (see Figure 1).  Specifically, participants were instructed to imagine each object in the color of the background frame and press a button to indicate whether or not the combination was pleasant.  Additionally, we instructed participants to integrate the objects together by imagining them interacting with each other.  We instructed participants to use this encoding strategy because it would help them with a later temporal order memory test. The background color frame remained the same for 6 consecutive trials and then switched to a new color. We operationalized objects that were studied consecutively in the same color as an ‘event’ and switches in color as an ‘event boundary’.  There were 6 events (totaling 36 objects) in each encoding block and 16 encoding/test blocks across the experiment. Each object was on the screen for 2.5 seconds, followed by a 2 second inter-trial interval and a .5 second fixation period.  The timing of the task was fixed (i.e. not jittered).

### Color Memory Test

After each encoding block, we tested two types of memory.  First, we tested object-color associative memory. In this test, a previously studied object appeared in the middle of the screen and two colors appeared below it.  One of the colors was studied with the object (target color), while the other was a lure color studied in a neighboring event.  Subjects were instructed to indicate which of the two colors was studied with the object and rate their confidence.  Thus, there were four possible responses during the test: High confidence target, low confidence target, high confidence lure and low confidence lure.  There were two conditions in the color memory test. The ‘boundary’ condition consisted of trials that were studied concurrent with a color switch.  The ‘non-boundary’ condition was comprised of trials from the middle of an event (specifically in the fourth position of an event). The test was self-paced with a mandatory .5 second fixation period between each test trial.

### Temporal Order Memory Test

After the color memory test, there was a temporal order memory test.  In this test, two previously studied objects were presented side by side without the colored background frame. Participants were asked to indicate which of the two objects appeared first in the sequence.  Like the color memory test, there were four possible responses (see above).  In the ‘within-event’ condition, objects from the 2nd and 6th within-event position were presented together and participants were asked to indicate which came first (position two would be the correct answer).  In the ‘across-boundary’ condition, objects studied in the 5th position of an event and the 3rd position of the next event were presented together (position 5 would be the correct answer).  Critically, all tested object pairs were separated by 3 intervening trials during encoding. Thus, while objects in the ‘within-event’ condition came from the same event, objects in the ‘across-boundary’ condition were studied in neighboring events and the amount of elapsed encoding time between the two test items for the two conditions was identical.

### MEG recordings and data processing

MEG data were recorded using a 157-channel whole-head axial gradiometer system (KIT, Kanazawa, Japan). Three reference channels seated above the MEG system were also recorded and used to remove ambient electromagnetic environmental noise from the data. MEG data were acquired with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, which was filtered online between XX and XX Hz, with a notch filter at XX Hz.  To measure head position, 5 electromagnetic coils were attached to a participant’s head. Coil locations were determined by registering scalp coil positions with 3D digitized head shape data (software: Source Signal Imaging, Inc.; hardware: Polhemus, Inc.), which was collected before MEG recording.  The anatomical locations used to register the coils with the head shape data were the nasion and the left and right periauricular points.  The coils were localized to the MEG sensors at the beginning and end of the experiment.

MEG data were preprocessed in the following way:  raw data were loaded into Matlab (version 7.10, Mathworks) and malfunctioning channels (average per subject: XX) were immediately removed and interpolated using a nearest neighbors approach (CITATION).  Then, data were denoised using a time-shifted principal components analysis approach, which removed ambient environmental noise using 3 reference channels (CITATION).  The remaining preprocessing steps used the Fieldtrip M/EEG software package (CITATION).  The data were band-pass filtered from 1-100 Hz.  Data were epoched from -4 to 4 seconds surrounding trial onset to assure adequate time for spectral estimation of both pre- and post-stimulus activity. The data were down-sampled to 500 Hz to speed processing time in later steps. Finally, to facilitate interpretation of topographies, we transformed the MEG data from axial to planar gradient.  One advantage of this linear transformation is that planar signal amplitude is typically largest directly above the source, whereas axial signal amplitudes are typically maximal on either side of the neural source of the signal.

After preprocessing, the MEG data were examined for artifacts.  The artifact rejection approach we took was three-fold: First, excessively noisy trials and channels were removed using Fieldtrip’s visual artifact rejection ‘trial summary’ feature. Specifically, channels trials for which the across-trial variance exceeded 3 standard deviations from the mean were removed from the analysis.  Then, independent components analysis was implemented to remove components related to eye blinks, eye movements, and heartbeat-related artifacts.  Finally, remaining trials were visually inspected and epochs containing any remaining artifacts were removed from the dataset (~XX% of trials).  

### Time-Frequency Analyses

A time-frequency transformation was applied to each epoch (-4 to 4 seconds, 50 ms sliding window, zero-padded) using a morlet wavelet approach (number of cycles=6) in Fieldtrip, estimating spectral power from 1 to 100 Hz in steps of 1Hz.  This analysis resulted in time-frequency spectrograms representing oscillatory power in each time-frequency-sensor point for each trial and each subject.  This relatively long epoch window allowed us to analyze data during the ‘stimulus on’ period (0 to 2.5 seconds) as well as the inter-trial periods (-2.5 to 0 seconds) while avoiding edge artifacts particularly in the low frequencies.  For analyses where power was averaged across the entire trial, data from the trial N (0 to 2.5 seconds) and the pre-stimulus period of the next trial (N+1; -2.5 to 0 seconds) were averaged.  This was because we centered the time-frequency analyses on the onset of each trial.

### Power Accumulation Analyses

To determine whether oscillatory power increased as a function of within event position, we adopted a general linear model approach (GLM). For each trial (~XX after artifact rejection), we averaged oscillatory power across the entire trial (0 to 5 seconds) for each frequency (1-100 Hz) and each sensor (n=157).  We then set up our ‘power accumulation’ model.  The power accumulation model was simply a mean-centered vector that linearly increased from 1 to 6 within each event and reset back to 1 at event boundaries (see Figure 2).  Put another way, the accumulation model indexed the within-event position of each trial.  Also included in the GLM was a regressor modeling the mean signal across the entire experiment as well as a regressor to account for mean signal differences across the 16 blocks. We then regressed the power data (separately for each band and sensor) against this model to obtain a t-statistic representing the fit of the oscillatory power data to the ‘accumulation’ model.  A model fit statistic (t-value) was obtained for each frequency bin and subject (as well as each sensor and time point depending upon the analysis).  Finally, to look for reliability of these model fits across subjects, we performed a group-level one-sample t-test at each frequency bin-sensor data point.

### Source Localization Analysis

Beamformer analysis (DICS; CITATION) was performed to estimate neural sources of the power accumulation effects. Each subject’s data was first registered to a structural template MPRAGE brain (FSL, XX) by aligning anatomical landmarks (nasion, left/right periauricular points) from the digitized head shape data to the structural brain image.  Then, oscillatory power (for the bands of interest: delta, theta and beta) was computed in source space for each trial during the stimulus on period (0-2.5 seconds).  We used only the ‘stimulus on’ periods in this analysis since this time period was the most significant in the sensor space analyses (see Figure 3).  The source-space data were fit to the same power accumulation model described above, to identify putative generators of the ramping within-event oscillatory neural activity.  Group-level reliability was then calculated with a one-sample t-test across subjects.

# Results

### Encoding

On each encoding trial, participants were instructed to imagine an object in the color of the background frame and decide if the combination was pleasant or unpleasant (62% rated as pleasant).  Encoding task response times (RTs) varied as a function of within-event position [F(5,80)=16.44, p<.0001], where follow-up pairwise t-tests reveal that RTs to boundary items were significantly slower than RTs to other positions [2-5, all p’s<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons] and there were no other differences.  This boundary-related RT cost replicates a previous study using this behavioral paradigm (Heusser et al, 20XX).

### Temporal Order Memory

After each encoding block, participants were asked to decide which of two previously studied items occurred earlier in the sequence (see Methods for more details).  We predicted that within-event temporal order memory would be greater than across-event order memory. Consistent with our hypothesis, temporal order memory was significantly more accurate in the within-event condition than the across-boundary condition [within-event condition: Mean=.73, SD=.12; across-boundary condition: Mean=.57, SD=.09; t(17)=5.56, p<.0001].  Critically, the temporal lag between the retrieval probes in both conditions was fixed at three and thus, the only difference between conditions was the occurrence of an intervening event boundary in the across-boundary condition.  These data suggest that event boundaries result in reduced temporal order memory (relative to within-event temporal order memory), consistent with previous studies (Heusser et al, 20XX; Dubrow et al, 2013).  Next, we tested whether response times during the temporal order retrieval task varied by condition.  We hypothesized that even when participants make a correct temporal order response, they might be slower to respond to across-boundary order test trials as compared to the within-event test trials.  Consistent with this prediction across-boundary test trial RTs [M=3.79s, SD= 1.67] were significantly slower than within-event test trial RTs [M=3.43s, SD=1.22; t(17)=2.36, p<.05].  Thus, in addition to reduced accuracy, when participants made a correct response in the across-boundary order condition, they were significantly slower.

### Object-Color Memory

We hypothesized that object-color memory at event boundaries would be facilitated relative to object-color memory for trials in the middle of an event (specifically, in the 4th position of an event).  To test this hypothesis, we probed memory for the object-color association for these two positions.  After each encoding block, we presented a previously studied object along with a target color (i.e. that color that was studied with the word) and a lure color (a color from a neighboring event).  Consistent with our hypothesis, object-color associative memory was significantly greater at boundaries [M=87.27%, SD=8.41%] then at non-boundaries [M=79.08%, SD=9.25%], suggesting that event boundaries facilitated object-color binding [t(17)=5.54, p<.001]. Next, we asked whether correct responses were speeded in the boundary condition, relative to the non-boundary condition.  We hypothesized that even when conditions were matched for accuracy, boundary trials would be accessed more quickly than non-boundary trials. Indeed, correct boundary RTs [M=2.05s, SD=.58] were on average half of a second faster than correct non-boundary RTs [M=2.54s, SD=.84], suggesting that color-object memory on boundary trials was accessed significantly faster than non-boundary trials [t(17)=-4.85, p<.001].  Both the temporal order and color memory findings are consistent with previous studies in our lab (Heusser et al 20XX). The remainder of this manuscript will focus on oscillatory activity during the encoding of events related to the integration of within-event information.

### Oscillatory power increases within events

To test our hypothesis that oscillatory power would increase within an event (i.e. 6 objects studied in with the same color) and drop off at event boundaries, we adopted a model-based regression approach (Figure 2, see Methods for details). For each subject, we fit an ‘accumulation’ model to the trial-level oscillatory power estimates. As described in the Methods, the accumulation model was simply a function that increased linearly within each event (i.e. 6 adjacent items with the same color backgrund; see Figure 2 for visual depiction). Power was averaged within each trial (0 - 2.5 seconds) and the modulation of power across trials was fit to the accumulation model.  First, we performed this across-trial regression analysis for each frequency band separately (1-100 Hz), averaging across all MEG sensors.  The results show well-defined peaks in the distribution of model fits in delta (2 Hz) and theta (7 Hz), as well as two peaks in the beta band (16 and 26 Hz), indicating that these frequency bands significantly fit the accumulation model [p’s<.001, Figure 2]. In addition to the parametric statistics, we also performed a permutation analysis, where for each iteration (n=1000), we shuffled the trial-level data (within-subject) and refit the model for every subject and then recomputed the group-level statistics.  The result was a null distribution of group-level model fit significance values for each frequency band.  The non-parametric statistics were very similar to the parametric tests and each frequency peak (in delta, theta and beta) remained significant (p<.001).  As an additional control analysis, we recomputed the fits between the power data in each frequency but shifted the phase of the accumulation model. We predicted that the model that was ‘in-phase’ with the event structure of our task would be the most significant, while ‘out-of-phase’ models would not show a reliable relationship to the data.  There were 5 possible phase-shifted models. None of the 5 out-of-phase models reached significance in any frequency band at our statistical threshold (p>.001). Thus, the model that was in-phase with the event structure of the task best fit the data. In summary, power in delta, theta and beta significantly co-varied with the event structure of the experiment, suggesting that these bands may play a role in event formation and segmentation.

### Temporal specificity of power accumulation effects

Our next analysis aimed to characterize what time periods during each trial showed the most robust power accumulation effects.  One possibility is that the stimulus-evoked response increase in magnitude across the event and drive the significant model fits reported above.  Alternatively, if power was gradually increasing across the event, one might expect the linear increases in power to be present for the duration of the trial and into the inter-trial interval.  For each trial, we computed a time-frequency spectrogram (-1 to 4 seconds in 50ms bins, 1-100 Hz in 1 Hz bins) and then fit the accumulation model across trials to each time-frequency data point.  This analysis resulted in a single time-frequency spectrogram (averaged across all MEG sensors), where each data point represents the fit to the accumulation model at a particular time point in a particular frequency (Figure 2).  The result of this analysis suggests that model fits were maximal during the time that the stimulus was on the screen, but were also robust in the post-stimulus time window (after 2.5 seconds when the stimulus was removed from the screen), suggesting that the power accumulation effects were not driven by the stimulus-evoked component and not limited to the temporal interval when the stimulus was on the screen.  Thus, these effect do not appear to be driven by stimulus-evoked activity alone, but rather more likely reflects cognitive processes evolving at longer timescales presumably tracking the event structure of the task.  

### Spatial specificity of power accumulation effects

Next, we sought to characterize the topographic distributions of the within-event power accumulation effects.  We limited our analyses to frequency bands that displayed peaks in the distribution of accumulation model fits (specifically, the delta, theta and beta bands).  We found that both delta and theta oscillatory accumulation model fits were significant and maximal over posterior sensors [Figure 3, p<.001, cluster threshold: p<.001, corrected at p<.05].  On the other hand, model fits to beta power were significant in more sensors distributed across most of the scalp [p<.001, cluster threshold: p<.001, corrected at p<.05].  
To verify that the within-event power increases that we’ve characterized thus far were driven by gradual increases in power within an event that drops at event boundaries (rather than being driven by another pattern of activity or alternatively, an artifact of the way we modeled the data), we extracted power estimates from sensors that showed a significant fit to the accumulation model.  Then, separately for each frequency band of interest (delta, theta, beta), we averaged the power data over significant sensors.  This resulted in a single time course of oscillatory power for each frequency band across the entire duration of the experiment.  To increase our signal to noise ratio, we downsampled our time courses, binning the power time courses into 500 millisecond chunks and and averaging.  We also averaged over all 16 encoding blocks (and across subjects).  Plotted in Figure 3 is the time course of oscillatory power for delta, theta and beta across an entire encoding block (i.e. 36 trials / 6 events). Each gray line represents the slope of the power increase within an event.  Visual inspection of the time courses clearly display accumulating power within an event that drops at the event boundaries in all three frequency bands of interest.  This analysis provides compelling evidence that oscillatory power in the delta, theta and beta bands tracks the event structure in our task.

### Ruling out potential confounds

We performed a series of control analyses to consider possible confounds and alternative explanations.  First, we noted that oscillatory power appeared to increase not only within an event, but also across the duration of a study block (see Figure 3). In other words, we observed power increases within an event but also power increases over a block of 36 trials.  To test whether our accumulation model analyses were driven by power changes across an encoding block (rather than power increases within an event), we regressed out block-level linear trends and recomputed the model fits on the residuals of this regression.  This did not account for the results, as the effects remained statistically robust (see Supplemental Figure XX).  We also noticed that overall power in the first event of a block was notably lower than the rest of the events.  Thus, we removed the first event from the analyses and recomputed the accumulation model analyses. Again, this did not change the pattern of results (see Supplemental Figure XX).  Another possibility is that evoked responses (i.e. ERPs) might contribute to this accumulation effect, rather than induced oscillatory activity.  To rule out this possibility, we subtracted out the average evoked response from each trial and recomputed the accumulation analysis.  This did not change the results, suggesting that trial-evoked responses did not explain the power accumulation effects.  Finally, we tested whether the accumulation effects were sensitive to baseline correction.  We baseline corrected each trial to the pre-stimulus period (-1000 to -500 ms).  Interestingly, the effects were eliminated (See Supplemental Figure XX), which is consistent with the idea that the power accumulation effects were not limited to the periods when the stimulus was on the screen, but may also exist in the pre-stimulus periods. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that the pre-stimulus oscillatory power in delta, theta and beta fits the accumulation model (See Figure 3).  Together, these data provide compelling evidence that oscillatory power in delta, theta and beta increases within an event and drops at event boundaries, and that this dynamic pattern likely reflects cognitive processes that evolve over the timescale of a temporally-extended episodic experience.

### Source Localization of the power accumulation effects

The purpose of the next analysis was to 1) localize the source(s) of within-event power accumulation signals and 2) test whether different frequency bands localized to different brain areas. To achieve this, we utilized a beamforming procedure (see Methods for details) to estimate oscillatory source power for each trial in three frequency bands of interest (delta, theta and beta). Given that we observed the strongest accumulation effects during the ‘stimulus on’ period in the trial (0 to 2.5 seconds), we averaged power across this epoch for each trial. We then fit the source space power data to the same power accumulation model as described above.  We (primarily) focused our analyses on the peaks in the frequency distribution of accumulation model fits (as shown in Figure 2), since these were the frequency bands that best fit our power accumulation model.  Delta (2 Hz) power accumulation was localized to the right hippocampus and right cerebellum. High theta (7 Hz) was localized to the right paracentral lobule.  Low beta (16 Hz) localized to the right MTL, right inferior frontal junction, and left premotor cortex.  High beta (26 Hz) localized to the cerebellum bilaterally, left lateral occipital complex (LO) and right parietal cortex.  Finally, given recent evidence suggesting that low theta (~3-4 Hz) is related to episodic memory in humans (Watrous et al; Jacobs et al), we source localized low theta (4 Hz) power accumulation.  This analysis localized low theta power accumulation to the left hippocampus/MTL, the left cerebellum (vermis VIIIa), and the left superior frontal sulcus.

Visual inspection revealed overlap in the source localization for theta (4 Hz) and low beta (16 Hz).  To quantify this overlap, we ran a conjunction analysis (joint p<.0001, individuals maps thresholded at p<.01).  This analysis revealed that source localization for beta and theta overlapped in the left MTL and a left insular region (Figure 3).  Thus, while low frequency power accumulation (4 Hz and lower) was localized primarily to the hippocampus and MTL, higher frequency beta power accumulation was localized to frontal and parietal regions (as well as MTL and LO) and there was overlap between the theta and beta source localization in the left MTL and insula.

### Power accumulation and subsequent temporal order memory

In the next set of analyses, we asked whether increasing power within an event was related to successful temporal order memory.  We focused our analyses on sensors that showed a significant fit to the accumulation model in our three bands of interest (delta, theta and beta). For each trial, we extracted power from sensors that displayed significant accumulation model fits (averaging across sensors). Then, we binned trials by the within-event trial position (1-6) and also by later within-event temporal order memory.  To test for differences in the pattern of power accumulation between hits and misses, we performed repeated-measures ANOVAs testing for a significant linear trend within an event. We excluded boundary trials (i.e. position 1) from this analysis, as they were not part of the temporal order memory decision (within-event temporal order judgment was on trials 2 and 6).  In all three bands, we observed a significant linear trend for events where order was later correct [delta: F(1,17)=19.88, p<.001; theta: F(1,17)=18.82, p<.001; beta: F(1,17)=29.83, p<.001], but not for incorrect events [delta: F(1,17)=.294, p>.1; theta: F(1,17)=1.53, p>.1; beta: F(1,17)=1.95, p>.1].  For beta (but not delta or theta; p’s>.2), there was also a significant position by memory interaction [F(4,68)=3.11, p=.02] and a trending interaction of the linear contrast [F(4,68)=3.76, p=.069]. Since differences in trial numbers between conditions can influence estimates of oscillatory power, we performed an additional sub-sampling analysis where for each iteration (n=1000) we randomly selected a subsample of trials to match the number of trials between conditions. Since every subject had more trials for the remember condition, this analysis essentially matched the number of trials in the ‘hits’ bin to the number of trials in the ‘misses’ bin.  We performed this analysis for all subjects and then averaged across the iterations and recomputed our statistics.  This analysis suggested that differences in trial numbers going into the power estimates did not account for differences in the linear trend as a function of conditions [linear trend for hits: delta: F(1,17)=20.74, p<.001; theta: F(1,17)=18.24, p<.001; beta: F(1,17)=30.19, p<.001; linear trend for misses same as reported above].  The significant memory by position interaction [F(1,17)=3.05, p=.02] and trending interaction in beta power of the linear contrast (hits vs. misses) was also replicated [F(1,17)=3.78, p=.07].  In summary, oscillatory power (in delta and theta, but most robustly in beta) during successful order encoding linearly increased over trials within an event and this linear pattern was not present when temporal order later incorrect.

Notably, this linear accumulation effect was not driven by overall greater power for temporal order correct events.  In fact, the opposite pattern was true: trials for which temporal order was later tested actually showed greater oscillatory power for misses as compared to hits [delta, 2nd position: t(17)=-2.12, p<.05; delta, 6 th position: t(17)=-2.09, p=.051; theta, 2nd position: t(17)=-2.03, p=.057; theta, 6th position: t(17)=-2.28, p<.05; beta, 2nd position: t(17)=-2.26, p<.05; no other significant differences].  Thus, the pattern of power accumulation across an event was predictive later order memory, but the absolute magnitude of power (in all three bands) was predictive of later mnemonic errors.

### Leveraging across-subject variability in power accumulation model fits

Next, we tested the prediction that variability in the extent to which individual participants fit the accumulation model would be related to within-event temporal order memory. Specifically, we predicted that subjects whose oscillatory power dynamics better fit the accumulation model would show better within-event temporal order memory as compared to subjects that poorly fit the model.  We limited our analyses to the delta, theta and beta bands averaging across the sensors that significantly fit the accumulation model (at the group-level).  Consistent with our prediction, beta accumulation model fits were positively correlated with within-event order memory [Figure 4; robust regression: t(16)=1.73, p<.05, one-tailed].  There was no such relationship in delta or theta [p’s>.1].  It’s worthwhile to note that if when we analyzed the data with a stricter statistical threshold (that is, averaging across sensors that exceeded a p<.0001 threshold), the correlation became stronger [robust regression: [t(16)=2.16, p<.05].  In summary, participants whose beta power dynamics better fit the event accumulation model showed relatively better temporal order memory.  

### Boundary-related decreases in power predict across-boundary order memory cost

The previous analyses were aimed to identify oscillatory activity that followed a linearly increasing pattern within an event.  In this next set of analyses, we test the hypothesis that event boundaries result in a significant drop in power. Although we’ve already provided evidence that oscillatory activity significantly fits our within-event accumulation model, it remains possible that this is pattern is not driven by a significant drop in power at boundaries.  For instance, a linear trend (within an event) could exist in the data without any significant differences between positions.  To test this, we extracted delta, theta and beta power data from sensors showing significant accumulation model fits (averaging across sensor) for trials in position 6 (i.e. the last trial before a boundary) and trials in position 1 (the first trial after a boundary).  We hypothesized that power would be significantly higher for trials in the last position of an event compared to trials in the first position of an event.  We found this to be true for all three bands [delta: t(17)=4.85, p<.001; theta: t(17)=5.05, p<.001; beta: t(17)=7.52, p<.001].  While this analysis is not entirely independent from within-event power accumulation analyses described earlier, it provides corroborating evidence that event boundaries result in a drop in a significant oscillatory power.

Next, we tested the hypothesis that boundary-related decreases in power would influence temporal order memory organization.  Our logic was the following: if power decreases at event boundaries represent flushing of event content from working memory, then subjects who displayed larger boundary-related decrease in oscillatory power might also show larger boundary-related cost in temporal order memory. For our three bands of interest, we extracted power from sensors showing significant accumulation model fit from trials in position 6 (i.e. the last trial in an event) and position 1 (i.e. the first trial after a boundary) and computed a difference score (position 6 minus position 1 power).  We hypothesized that this difference score might represent an individual’s neural sensitivity to event boundaries.  Then, for each subject, we computed a boundary-related order memory cost index by subtracting overall across-boundary order memory from within-event order memory. This difference score served as a proxy for how much the boundaries reduced across-event temporal order memory (relative to within-event order memory).  We removed one outlier whose behavioral difference score was 2.37 standard deviations from the mean.  We found that the boundary-related decrease in beta power (but not theta or delta,) was correlated with the magnitude of the across-boundary order memory cost [Figure 5; robust regression: t(16)=2.99, p<.01]. This correlation remained significant when including the outlier subject in the analysis [robust regression: t(17)=2.58, p<.05]. We did not observe this pattern in delta or theta (both p’s>.4).  When considering the within-event and across-event trials alone, there was trending effect for within-event [robust regression: t(17)=1.66, p=.06] and no effect for across-event [robust regression: t(17)=.83, p=.11].  Thus, the subtraction likely acted as a baseline to remove gross across-subject memory differences that might have dampened this relationship. This finding suggests that the magnitude of drop in beta power at event boundaries is related to the impact of event boundaries on temporal order memory.

# Discussion

In this study, we recorded oscillatory brain activity during the encoding of temporally extended experiences and found that temporal dynamics in delta, theta and beta power tracked the event structure in our experiment.  Specifically, oscillatory power accumulated within an event, or a sequence of 6 adjacent trials with a shared background color, and then dropped sharply at boundaries between events.  Moreover, linear increases in power within each event were related to temporal order memory success, suggesting that these frequency bands (delta, theta and beta) may play an important role in the organization of temporally extended memories. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that neural oscillations play a prominent role in the formation of episodic memories.  Furthermore, our unique across-trial regression approach to the MEG data highlights the importance of considering oscillatory dynamics across longer time scales than what has been typical in the literature.

### Delta/Theta oscillations and temporal memory formation

The pattern of accumulating theta power within an event is consistent with prior research demonstrating that increases in theta power are correlated with working memory load (Jensen and Tesche).  Furthermore, a recent EEG study found that (frontal) theta power was greater during the maintenance of temporal order information as compared to item maintenance alone (Hsieh and Ranganath). In the current study, subjects may be accumulating/maintaining within-event item representations as an event unfolds. If that is the case, then one might expect theta power to increase with each additional maintained item (as working memory load increases).  This is exactly the pattern of results that we observed.  Moreover, theta power accumulated specifically when the order of the items within the event was successfully encoded (and not when temporal order was incorrect), suggesting that dynamic increases in theta power across an event may support temporal order encoding.  One interpretation of this pattern is that accumulating theta power within an event is a by-product of neural processes supporting the maintenance of multiple items in working memory. Neural representations of items that are co-active in working memory might become associatively bound to one another, which could support the recovery of temporal information on a later test, and explain why accumulating theta power is related to temporal order memory success. This interaction between a working memory ‘buffer’ and long-term associative memory is predicted by memory models that posit that items may become associatively bound in long-term memory via a ‘buffer’-like process active during encoding (Lehman and Malmberg).

There is a good deal of evidence now that theta oscillations also play a role in long-term memory encoding (REFS), and some recent work has argued that theta oscillations may play a more specific role in associative binding (REFS).  Summerfield and Mangels (2005) found that successful word-color associative memory was accompanied by an increase in frontal theta power, as well as an increase in frontal-posterior theta coherence.  In another relevant study, Staudigl and Hanslmayr (2013) recorded oscillatory activity while subjects encoded words that were superimposed on a background movie. Then, they test memory for the words, where some trials were presented intact (same word, same movie) while other trials were rearranged (same word, different movie).  Interestingly, for intact test trials they found that greater theta power during encoding was predictive of item memory. However, for rearranged test trials, the reverse pattern (i.e. relatively less theta power during encoding) was predictive item memory.  This suggests that theta power during encoding indexes item-context binding, since presumably greater item-context binding would facilitate retrieval in the intact condition, but not in the rearranged condition.  Taken together, these results are consistent with the idea that theta oscillations may be an index of neural processes generally supporting associative binding, whether its within-trial (i.e. item-context) or across multiple trials (i.e. item-item).  

Our source analyses suggest that delta and theta power accumulation appear to be localized to the left hippocampus and right medial temporal lobes (MTL), respectively. This is consistent with previous research that has shown that theta oscillations in the MTL appear to play a critical role in successful memory encoding (CITATIONS).  While some caution is warranted due to the difficult problem of deep source localization (REFS), given the robust literature on MTL contributions to memory encoding paired with the localization results here, we hypothesize that the within-event delta/theta power accumulation effects we observed in this study are indeed generated by MTL structures.  Future studies could utilize convergent techniques with higher spatial resolution (i.e. intracranial EEG) to validate this localization.

### The Role of Beta Oscillations in the Maintenance of the Status Quo

In addition to accumulating theta power, we also found a robust relationship between accumulating beta power and temporal order memory within events (Figure XX). Like theta power, accumulating beta power within an event was predictive of temporal order memory success. Furthermore, subjects who showed larger boundary-related drops in beta power also had better within- vs. across-event temporal order memory, suggesting that beta power dynamics have bearing on memory organization.

In a review of the literature, Engel and Fries (2010) propose that beta oscillations might index the ‘maintenance of the status quo’.  This theory was primarily inspired by research in the motor domain which has shown that beta power is elevated during sustained motor operations (i.e. holding a posture) and decreases during voluntary movements (REFS).  The authors suggest that if beta oscillations index the maintenance of a particular motor state, then they may also be elevated during the maintenance of a cognitive set (and in other situations of high levels of endogenous attention) and decrease in the face of novel or unexpected events.  Our results fit well within this framework: we found that beta oscillations increased monotonically as the event unfolded, and rapidly dropped at event boundaries (i.e. when the background changed to a new novel color). Bolstered by this theoretical work, we speculate that the beta oscillations we observed here might index the maintenance of a ‘cognitive set’, or perhaps an ‘event model’, a construct that is central to event segmentation theory (REFS).

Beta oscillations have also been directly linked with successful memory encoding.  In a series of intriguing studies, Hanslmayr and colleagues found that beta desynchronization in the frontal cortex is predictive of subsequent memory and is also positively correlated with BOLD activity.  Furthermore, the authors found that entrainment of the frontal cortex to the beta frequency (but not theta or alpha entrainment) during encoding selectively impaired later memory (Hanslmayr). A possible explanation for this finding is that beta desynchronization may actually lead to a richer, more unique neural representation (REFS).  This prediction stems from the idea that theoretically, desynchronized brain activity has a higher information capacity than synchronized activity (REFs).  Connecting this idea to the current work, we speculate that accumulating beta power (i.e. increases in synchronized activity) may represent the maintenance of a prior cognitive set (or event model).  At event boundaries, when the background is updated to a novel color, the sharp drop in beta power may reflect bottom-up processing of novel perceptual information, which may require relatively greater processing bandwidth.  Thus, while beta power accumulation may be beneficial to forming associative relationships among a group of items, at the same time greater beta power may be detrimental to encoding in scenarios where item distinctiveness is important for memory. Future work should directly test this tentative hypothesis.

While low frequency power accumulation was localized to MTL structures, beta power accumulation was localized to regions including the frontal and parietal cortex (as well as the MTL; see Supplemental Table XX full list).  Prior studies have found that synchronized beta activity between frontal and parietal regions increases under conditions of high top-down endogenous attention (Buchsman and Miller; Buchsman and Miller).  Thus, the observed increase in beta power within an event could reflect an increase in exogenous attention necessary to maintain accumulating items in working memory. Thus, at boundaries, the drop in beta power could reflect a shift from endogenous to exogenous attention.

Finally, we observed overlap in the source localization of theta and beta in the medial temporal lobe (as well as the insula).  Both theta (CITATIONS) and beta (Kopell, Traub) have been observed in medial temporal lobe structures.  Empirical data and computational models support the idea that while higher frequency bands (such as gamma) can be used for relatively local neural computations, it’s possible for distal brain regions to synchronize at lower frequencies (<gamma). Thus, both of beta and theta in the hippocampus could be involved in the integration of representations that are distributed across different brain regions in the service of episodic memory encoding.  Future work should address if and how these frequencies might interact.

### Summary

In summary, these findings suggest that accumulating oscillatory power across multiple trials in the delta, theta and beta band play a role in memory encoding and organization.
