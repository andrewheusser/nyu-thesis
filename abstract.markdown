Episodic memories are the neural imprints of our life experiences, are often rich in contextual detail and can extend over long periods of time. A great deal of exceptional research has been conducted to understand how our brains form memories for the individual components of an episodic memory, but less is known about how the brain encodes experiences that span over longer periods of time and involve multiple sequential components. The encoding of temporally-extended episodic memories requires a neural mechanism capable of binding information that is experienced at distinct points in space and time.  Emerging evidence suggests that one prominent function of neural oscillations, or rhythmic changed is neuronal excitability, may be to associate neural representations distributed across distinct brain regions and integrate information experiences at different points in time.  The focus of this thesis is to investigate whether and how oscillatory neural mechanisms might support the encoding of temporally-extended episodic memories.
