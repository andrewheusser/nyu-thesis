# Abstract

The meaning we derive from our experiences is not a simple static extraction of the elements but, rather, is largely based on the order in which those elements occur. Influential theoretical models propose that the encoding of sequences of elements (or items) may be supported by interactions between high and low frequency brain rhythms, such that items within an episode are represented by neural cell assemblies firing at higher frequencies (i.e. gamma) and their relative sequential order is coded by the specific timing of firing with respect to a slower frequency rhythm (i.e. theta). Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record neural oscillations during episodic sequence memory formation in humans, we provide evidence that items in different ordinal positions within a sequence exhibit relatively greater gamma power along distinct phases of an underlying theta oscillation.  Furthermore, this segregation is related to successful memory for the order of the items. These results provide compelling evidence that memory for order, a core component of an episodic memory trace, capitalizes on the seemingly ubiquitous physiological mechanism of theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling.

# Introduction

While many aspects of our cognition and behavior, including language processing, spatial navigation and episodic memory, share the requirement to represent, encode and retrieve temporal sequences of events, how the brain accomplishes this is still not well understood. It is has been known for decades that two stimuli that activate interconnected neurons can result in long-term potentiation (LTP) of the bridging synapse [@bliss_long-lasting_1973], thus supporting an association between the two, and compelling new research has provided causal evidence for a link between LTP and associative memory formation [@nabavi_engineering_2014].   However, the model of long-term potentiation in its current form is not viable for stimuli (or neurons) whose activation is separated by more than ~300 ms, and unarguably, much of what we encode and remember is separated by temporal gaps at least an order of magnitude large than this. Thus, a central issue in understanding temporal sequence learning is how the brain can bridge and relate stimuli that are encountered across seconds or minutes.

To deal with this conundrum, mechanistic models of sequence encoding posit that the temporal coding of sequences can be supported by neural oscillations [@lisman_storage_1995; @jensen_hippocampal_1996; @lisman_-_2013; @jensen_physiologically_1996; @koene_first-first-out_2007], or rhythmic fluctuations in neuronal excitability (see @buzsaki_neuronal_2004 for review). One influential model of sequence encoding [@lisman_storage_1995; @lisman_-_2013] hypothesizes that individual items are represented by largely non-overlapping neural cell assemblies that, when activated, fire in high frequency bands (i.e. gamma: >30 Hz), while the relative sequential order of those items is coded in a temporally segregated manner along the phase of an underlying slower rhythm (i.e. theta: ~3-8 Hz).  It follows then that during the encoding of a sequence, the current item is represented and encoded by transient higher frequency activity, while the relative position of each item in a sequence may be coded by the relative phase of a lower frequency oscillation (referred to as ‘phase coding’). Theoretically, phase coding allows the temporal segregation of activity supporting individual items that are encountered at different times across an experience, and critically may also permit temporally extended experiences to be represented in a time-compressed manner [@jensen_physiologically_1996] (~100-300 ms cycles of neuronal activity).

There is ample evidence that modulation of gamma power by theta phase (i.e. phase-amplitude coupling or ‘PAC’) is important for learning and memory formation [@axmacher_cross-frequency_2010; @tort_thetagamma_2009; @friese_successful_2013; @fuentemilla_theta-coupled_2010; @lega_slow-theta--gamma_2014] as well as other cognitive processes [@canolty_high_2006; @giraud_cortical_2012; @szczepanski_dynamic_2014]. However, to date, there is little evidence that theta phase coding, or the segregation of item-specific neural assemblies on distinct phases of an underlying theta oscillation, serves as a mechanism for human sequence memory encoding. We set out to test this fundamental question by presenting participants with six-item sequences each consisting of pictures of trial-unique objects that were embedded on a repeating background colored frame (Figure 3.1a) while recording brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The colored frame defined each six-item sequence as the color switched every six trials. We later tested participants sequence memory by asking them to recognize the correct order of two previously presented objects during retrieval.  Thus, we could ask whether gamma power associated with each item in a sequence (positions 1-6) is relatively biased towards distinct phases of theta (i.e. phase coding).  Importantly, we also assessed whether theta phase coding was behaviorally relevant by examining phase coding effects during both successful and unsuccessful temporal order encoding.

# Methods

### Participants

Twenty healthy right-handed native English speakers (4 males, age range: 21-35, mean age: 28) recruited from New York University and the greater New York metropolitan area participated in the MEG experiment.  The study was approved by the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects and all participants gave informed written consent.  We excluded two subjects whose performance on the order memory test was not significantly different from chance (50%, using binomial test) and one subject who did not complete the study due to drowsiness.  We excluded these participants, leaving 17 subjects for the MEG analyses.

### Materials

Stimuli consisted of 576 gray-scale pictures of objects collected from various online sources.  Some examples of stimuli can be seen in the main text (Figure 3.1).  Colored borders for the objects were generated by selecting 24 unique colors from a color continuum ranging from [0,0,0] to [255,255,255] RGB values.  Colors were manually chosen to be maximally distinct from each other.

### Design and Procedure

*Encoding*. During encoding, participants made pleasant/unpleasant decisions on trial-unique objects that were paired with a colored background frame.  Specifically, participants were instructed to imagine each object in the color of the background frame and press a button to indicate whether or not the combination was pleasant.  We chose to use this encoding task to encourage participants to associate the color and object, since attention to the context (i.e. color) was critical to our hypothesis.  To promote successful temporal order memory, we additionally instructed participants to associate neighboring objects together by imagining them interacting with each other.  Subjects were instructed to perform this task irrespective of the color changes between some of the items.  Pilot data indicated that this instructional manipulation was critical to achieving above chance temporal order memory performance in a majority of our participants.

During the encoding task, the background color frame remained the same for 6 consecutive trials (i.e. a ‘sequence’) and then switched to a new color.  There were 6 sequences (totaling 36 objects) in each encoding block and 16 encoding/test blocks across the experiment. Each object was on the screen for 2.5 seconds, followed by a 2 second inter-trial interval (ITI) and a .5 second fixation period.  The timing of the task was fixed (i.e. not jittered). During the ITI and fixation period, the color frame remained on the screen.

*Temporal order memory test.* After each study block, we tested temporal order memory.  We used this temporal order test as a proxy for probing intact sequence memory.  In this test, two previously studied objects were presented side by side (with the previously colored background frame now gray). Participants were asked to indicate which of the two objects appeared first (earlier) in the sequence and rate their confidence using a 4 alternative forced choice design.  Thus, there were four possible responses during the test: high confidence correct order, low confidence correct order, high confidence incorrect order and low confidence incorrect order. The tested objects always occurred in the 2nd and 6th position within a sequence and all tested object pairs were separated by 3 intervening trials during encoding. The test was self-paced with a mandatory .5 second fixation period between each test trial.

### MEG recordings and data processing

MEG data were recorded using a 157-channel whole-head axial gradiometer system (KIT, Kanazawa, Japan). Three reference channels seated above the MEG system were also recorded and used to remove ambient electromagnetic environmental noise from the data. MEG data were acquired in DC with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, a low pass filter at 200 Hz and a notch filter at 60 Hz to remove line noise.  To measure head position, 5 electromagnetic coils were attached to a participant’s head during recording. Coil locations were determined by registering scalp coil positions with 3D digitized head shape data (software: Source Signal Imaging, Inc.; hardware: Polhemus, Inc.), which was collected before MEG recording.  The anatomical locations used to register the coils with the head shape data were the nasion and the left and right periauricular points.  The coils were localized to the MEG sensors at the beginning and end of the experiment.

MEG data were preprocessed as follows: raw MEG data were loaded into MATLAB (version 7.10, Mathworks) and malfunctioning channels (average per subject: ~2) were immediately removed and interpolated with the average of its nearest neighbors.  Then, data were denoised using a time-shifted principal components analysis approach (temporal shift parameter = 100ms), which removed ambient environmental noise using 3 reference channels [@de_cheveigne_denoising_2007].  The remaining preprocessing steps utilized the Fieldtrip M/EEG software package [@oostenveld_fieldtrip:_2010] and custom MATLAB scripts.  The data were band-pass filtered (default settings in eegfilt.m) from 1-100 Hz.  Then, the data were epoched from -4 to 4 seconds surrounding trial onset to assure adequate time for spectral estimation of both pre- and post-stimulus activity. The epochs were downsampled to 500 Hz to speed processing time in later steps. Finally, to facilitate interpretation of topographic plots, we transformed the MEG data from axial to planar gradient.  One advantage of this linear transformation is that planar signal amplitude is typically largest directly above the source, whereas axial signal amplitudes are typically maximal on either side of the neural source of the signal.  This transformation was performed for all topographic analyses, but not the source-space analyses.

After preprocessing, the MEG data were examined for artifacts.  The artifact rejection approach we took was three-fold: First, excessively noisy trials and channels were removed using Fieldtrip’s visual artifact rejection ‘trial summary’ feature. Specifically, channels and trials for which the across-trial variance exceeded 3 standard deviations from the mean were identified and removed from the analysis.  Then, independent component analysis was implemented to remove components related to eye blinks, eye movements, and heartbeat-related artifacts.  Finally, remaining trials were visually inspected and epochs containing any remaining artifacts were removed from the dataset.  The group average proportion of trials removed due to artifacts was ~8.6%.

### Time-Frequency Power Analyses

A time-frequency analysis was performed for each epoch (-4 to 4 seconds, 50 ms sliding window, zero-padded) using a morlet wavelet approach (number of cycles=6), estimating spectral power from 1 to 100 Hz in steps of 1 Hz.  This analysis resulted in time-frequency spectrograms representing oscillatory power for each time-frequency-sensor point for each trial and each subject.  This relatively long epoch window allowed us to analyze data during the ‘stimulus on’ period (0 to 2.5 seconds) as well as the inter-trial periods (-2.5 to 0 seconds) while avoiding edge artifacts particularly in the low frequencies.

### Cross-Frequency Coupling Analyses

Phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PAC) was estimated as follows for each trial for each sensor and subject.  The algorithm to compute the PAC ‘modulation index’ (referred to as MI or coupling values/estimates) was taken from @tort_measuring_2010.  First, to compute gamma amplitude, raw MEG time-series (for each trial/sensor) was filtered from 70-100 Hz, which was determined by frequencies that showed a peak in the spectral power distribution (Supplemental Figure 3.1).  The envelope was then computed by taking the absolute value of the Hilbert Transform of the filtered time-series. To compute theta phase, the raw data was filtered from 3 to 8 Hz in steps of 1 Hz resulting in 5 filtered time-series (i.e. 3-4, 4-5, etc.). We filtered in steps of 1 Hz instead of the range of the band (3-8 Hz) because we wanted to minimize the possibility that changes in the peak frequency of the theta band could explain our findings.  Phase was computed for each of the 5 filtered time series by taking the angle of the Hilbert transform of the filtered signal.  Then we binned gamma power by theta phase (18 bins) during stimulus presentation (0-2.5 seconds), now averaging across the 5 theta sub bins, resulting in a single theta-binned gamma histogram for each trial.  We then normalized the distributions, such that the power of each histogram summed to one.  Finally, we computed Kullback-Leibler divergence for each theta-binned gamma distribution and divided by the log(18) i.e. the number of phase bins.

In order to determine statistical significance of the coupling values, we employed a permutation procedure [@canolty_high_2006]. For each trial, we recomputed the coupling analysis described above, but circularly shifted the time-series of phase values by a random interval greater than 500 samples (i.e. the sampling rate, 1 second).  For each trial (and theta phase sub-bin), we repeated this phase-shifting process 100 times to derive a null distribution of coupling values.  We then converted the coupling estimates to statistical values (z-statistics). To calculate within-subject statistics, we computed a t-statistic across trials (averaging across theta-sub bin, i.e. one value per trial) for each sensor and subject.  Then, to calculate group-level statistics, we computed a t-statistic across subjects for each sensor.

### Fitting Theta-Gamma Coupling Estimates to the Model

Our initial hypothesis was that as items are maintained in and integrated into working memory, additional gamma cycles would be concatenated along the phase of theta 19. To simulate this hypothesis and test for this pattern in our data, we generated theta (4 Hz) sinusoidal waves (10 cycles to mimic our 2.5 second stimulus presentation), adding 1 to 6 cycles of a gamma rhythm (85 Hz) per theta cycle. The 6 different simulations represented our hypotheses for the 6 positions within a sequence.  We then computed the predicted coupling score (i.e. modulation index) for each of these simulations.  Due to an increase in the width of the distribution of gamma over theta as function of sequence trial position, our simulation predicted linearly decreasing coupling values across sequence positions (see Figure 3.1b and c for visual depiction).  

To test for this pattern of broadening gamma over theta in our data, we performed a linear regression on the trial-wise estimates of theta-gamma coupling.  The predictor (independent) variable was our simulated hypothesis (described above) and the dependent variable was a vector of observed coupling estimates.  To construct the vectors of coupling values, for each trial/sensor/subject, we averaged together the coupling estimates across theta sub-bins so that there was a single coupling value per trial.  We then performed a separate linear regression analysis (independent: model-predicted coupling value, dependent: trial-wise coupling estimate) for each sensor/subject, resulting in subject-level topographic statistical maps (t-values) representing the fits of our model to the empirically observed coupling estimates. Then to compute group-level statistics, we computed a t-statistic across subjects for each sensor (see Figure 3.1d). To correct for multiple comparisons, we derived a statistical threshold based on the size of a cluster of sensors compared to what one might expect by chance.  For each sensor/subject, we shuffled the trial labels (1000 times) and then refit the model. Then, we recomputed cluster sizes on each iteration to build a null distribution of maximum cluster sizes expected by chance and only retained clusters exceeding p<.05 of the null distribution of cluster sizes.  Only clusters of sensors that exceeded this threshold were further analyzed.  

To control for power differences across a sequence as a potential confounding factor for the analyses described above, we performed a second regression analysis where first, a general linear model with theta and gamma power (as separate predictor variables) was constructed and regressed against the coupling estimates. We then refit our model (i.e. decreasing coupling by sequence position) to the residuals of this model. Thus, any explanatory power that theta or gamma power had on theta-gamma coupling was removed. The result of this analysis is plotted in  Figure 3.7.

### Theta-Gamma Model Source Localization Analysis

A linearly-constrained minimum-variance beamformer analysis [@van_veen_localization_1997] was performed to estimate neural sources of the decreasing theta-gamma coupling by sequence position. Briefly, this technique utilizes an adaptive spatial filtering algorithm designed to estimate sources of neural activity originating from a spatial location in the brain given a particular topographic distribution of MEG activity by applying a unit gain constraint to the spatial location of interest and minimizing the contribution of all other sources.  First, each subject’s data was registered to a canonical structural MPRAGE brain from the FSL software package [@jenkinson_fsl_2012]. This was achieved by aligning anatomical landmarks (nasion, left/right periauricular points) from digitized head shape data to the structural brain image for each subject.  To estimate source-space time-series data, we used a combination of source analysis script from the Fieldtrip software package as well as custom MATLAB scripts.  A semi-realistic head model was constructed following methods described by *ADD THIS REFERENCE* Nolte et al (2003).  Then, using the MEG data from all trials (irrespective of sequence position), a common spatial filter was estimated for each point in a three dimensional grid representing potential neural source locations with 1 centimeter spacing between points. The result of this analysis was a vector of spatial weights (1 x 157, i.e. the total number of MEG sensors) mapping the contribution of each sensor’s activity to a particular grid (i.e. brain) location. Then, to derive source-space time series for each trial (-1 to 3.5 seconds), the matrix of sensor-level time series (157 sensors x 2251 time points for each trial) was multiplied by the spatial weight matrix, resulting in a single time course for each source location for each trial.

Once the all the sensor-level data was projected into source space, we performed an analysis very similar to the sensor-level theta-gamma model fit analyses described above. For each trial (during stimulus presentation, 0 to 2.5 seconds) and source-space location, we bandpass filtered the data in the high gamma band (70-100 Hz; using default filter settings of eegfilt.m) and computed gamma amplitude by taking the absolute value of the Hilbert transform of the filtered signal.  Then, we derived the theta phase time course by bandpass filtering the data in the theta frequency range (3-8 Hz; using default filter settings of eegfilt.m) and then computed the angle of the Hilbert transform of the filtered signal. The remainder of the analysis was identical to the sensor-level theta-gamma model fitting analyses described above.  Briefly, for every subject, we computed theta-gamma coupling for each trial/source-space point and fit the theta-gamma coupling source-space point to our model of decreasing theta-gamma coupling as a function of sequence position. Then, to compute group-level statistics, we computed t-statistics across subjects for every source-space point.  The final product was a 3D source-space statistical map of t-values representing the group reliability of the fit of theta-gamma coupling to our model of decreasing coupling across sequence positions.  Note that there is typically a center bias for beamformer source localization when a source is localized without respect to a baseline (i.e. pre-stimulus period or another condition). Given that the regression analysis we ran is a linear contrast across sequence positions, this potential confound is likely not a contributing factor.

### Phase Analyses

We hypothesized that for items in different sequence positions, gamma power would be biased to different phases of theta, particularly when temporal order was successfully encoded.  To test this, for each trial, we computed histograms of gamma power binned by theta phase (18 bins; power and phase computations are described above in Cross-frequency Coupling Analyses section) for each sensor. We then averaged across clusters of sensors that displayed a significant fit to our model (i.e. decreasing coupling by sequence position), which resulted in two clusters (a left lateral cluster and a left posterior cluster), and then sorted sequences by subsequent temporal order memory. To test whether the theta-binned gamma distributions differed by sequence position, we used a Watson-Williams multi-sample test for equal means implemented from the Circular Statistics Toolbox for MATLAB [@berens_circstat:_2009].  This test is effectively a one-way ANOVA for circular-linear data.  To compute significance of the interaction between position and sequence memory, we used a Harrison-Kanji Test, a circular implementation of a two-way ANOVA.  It should be noted that all phase analyses described in this section were statistically tested using circular-linear tests unless otherwise specified.

In a follow up analysis, we then averaged the trials into 3 bins by sequence position: 1&2 (early), 3&4 (middle) and 5&6 (late). Finally, we averaged the data across subjects.  The result of this analysis was 6 histograms (for each cluster of interest) of gamma power binned by theta phase for early, middle and late sequence trials and for sequences where later temporal order was correct and incorrect (plotted in Figure 3.3).

To compute theta phase locking (also known as ‘inter-trial’ phase coherence), we followed methods outlined in 64 (see Figure 3.3c in the referenced paper).  Briefly, for each trial, we filtered the data at the theta frequency.  Then, we computed the Hilbert transform and normalized the resulting complex vectors to remove the amplitude component.  Finally, for each time point, we computed the phase locking value by averaging the normalized vectors across trials for a given condition for each subject.

### Sequence memory performance

During each encoding-retrieval block, participants encoded six 6-item sequences (for a total of 36 consecutive object stimuli) before being tested for the temporal order of pairs of object stimuli from each presented sequence.  Behaviorally, temporal order memory for pairs of object stimuli studied within a sequence (specifically positions 2 and 6 of a six-item train) was well above chance ($\mu$ = .74, $\sigma$ = .12, chance was .5), confirming that temporal order encoding was feasible (but not always attainable) in our task design which, importantly, allowed us to compare successful to unsuccessful encoding of sequences.

### Theta/gamma power and coupling during sequence encoding

Before testing the critical hypotheses concerning whether theta-gamma interactions are related to successful sequence memory formation, we first characterized the distribution of spectral power in the MEG data in a broad range of frequency bands (1-100 Hz) during stimulus encoding (0 to 2.5 seconds), baseline corrected relative to a pre-stimulus time period (-1 to 0 seconds), averaging power over time, trials, sensors, and subjects. This quantitative analysis provides a global measure of the frequency content of the signal and allows identification of reliable peaks in the power spectra, since spectral peaks are necessary for a meaningful estimate of phase - and ultimately a reliable estimate of cross-frequency coupling [@aru_untangling_2015]. We found distinct peaks in the spectral power distributions in both the theta (3-8 Hz) and high gamma (70-100 Hz) bands that were present during each trial presentation as compared to a pre-stimulus baseline period (-1 to 0 seconds) (Figure 3.4). Using these spectral power peaks to constrain frequencies of interest, we next tested whether any reliable relationship between theta and gamma oscillations were present in our data using a well-characterized PAC measure that tests for the tendency of power in a higher frequency to be biased towards any particular phase of a lower frequency [@tort_measuring_2010; @tort_thetagamma_2009].  Using a permutation-based bootstrapping technique (inspired by @canolty_high_2006; see Online Methods), we identified significant theta-gamma PAC in a number of MEG sensors distributed across the scalp (_t_ > 3.96, _p_ < .001, Figure 3.5).

### Modulation of theta-gamma coupling by sequence position

Next, we asked whether theta-gamma PAC was modulated across items within each event (6-item sequence). If items are temporally coded by gamma power that is biased towards distinct phases of theta, then theta-gamma coupling may be parametrically modulated as a function of an item’s position within a sequence.  We hypothesized that the encoding of items in the initial part of a sequence should be associated with a tight theta phase - gamma amplitude relationship (and thus a high coupling score) because a single item would be represented and maintained at a particular phase on repeating cycles of theta [@jensen_hippocampal_1996; @jensen_hippocampal_1996].  However, as subsequent items are encountered within a sequence, additional gamma cycles (representing additional items) would become present and hence result in the widening of the overall distribution of gamma power over the phase of theta (see Figure 3.1b for schematic of the hypothesized modulation by position). This would, somewhat counter-intuitively, result in an overall reduction in our measure of theta-gamma coupling as more items are added into the sequence. To, quantify this hypothesis, we ran a simulation of theta-gamma coupling where, for each trial within a sequence, additional gamma cycles (representing additional items in the sequence) were concatenated along the phase of a theta oscillation. PAC was then estimated on the simulated data. This verified our intuition that if our hypothesis is correct, our PAC measure should linearly decrease across trials when estimated separately for each trial within a sequence (Figure 3.1c).

Based on the results of the simulation, we then examined the MEG data for this pattern of decreasing theta-gamma PAC across each 6-item sequence.  For each position in the 6-item sequence, we estimated average theta-gamma PAC during each stimulus presentation (0-2.5 seconds). Then, using the pattern estimated by our simulated hypothesis as a predictor variable (i.e. a linear decrease in PAC across positions within a sequence; Figure 1c), we performed a linear regression on the PAC estimates to identify sensors that displayed the predicted pattern of results. We found two clusters of sensors (left lateral and left posterior) that reliably fit our model at the group-level (Figure 3.1d; thresholded at _t_(16) > 2.1, _p_ < .05; cluster-corrected using permutation test procedure, see Methods).  To verify that this result was driven by our expected pattern, we then extracted theta-gamma PAC estimates (as well as power estimates) from sensors that showed a significant fit to our model and plotted the group average theta-gamma PAC estimate for each sequence position. Visual inspection confirms a linearly decreasing pattern across the sequence, consistent with the PAC simulation (Figure 3.6).  While there was a linear increase in theta power over sequence positions, regressing out the power values (both theta and gamma) had virtually no effect on the PAC model fits (See Figure 3.7; _F_(1,5332) = .002, _p_ = .96) and thus do not appear to interact with the PAC effects.  In summary, we found that theta-gamma PAC decreased across items in a sequence, consistent with the idea that sequence encoding may be supported by the concatenation of gamma cycles at distinct, consecutive phases of theta for each additional item in the sequence.

### Source localization of theta-gamma coupling decreases over sequence position

So far, we have provided evidence that theta-gamma PAC during object sequence encoding decreases across sequential positions, consistent with the notion that items in a sequence may be coded by gamma cycles aligned sequentially along distinct yet consecutive phases of an underlying theta cycle. Theoretical models [@jensen_hippocampal_1996; @jensen_hippocampal_2005] and empirical research in humans [@dubrow_temporal_2014; @hsieh_hippocampal_2014; @jenkins_prefrontal_2010; @tubridy_medial_2011; @davachi_how_2015; @ezzyat_similarity_2014] and rodents [@fortin_critical_2002; @kesner_role_2002] all point towards the hippocampus as being a structure that is critical for the formation of temporal associations among items. In humans, fMRI and intracranial EEG recordings have allowed for the precise characterization of hippocampal signals in spatial resolution on the order of millimeters.  While MEG is well suited for fine temporal analysis of brain activity, recent advances in source localization methods have made it possible to localize sources of MEG activity to a spatial resolution on the order of single centimeters, or even millimeters [@dalal_spatial_2007].  Additionally, a growing number of papers [@attal_assessment_2013; @dalal_simultaneous_2013; @staudigl_theta_2013] and simulations [@mills_techniques_2012; @quraan_detection_2011] argue that source localization of MEG signals is possible to subcortical structures such as the hippocampus, however the parameters required to accurately source localize deep structures is still controversial and actively debated in the literature. Nonetheless, we applied best practice and performed a source localization analysis on our MEG data. To that end, we first estimated trial-level time series in source space using a linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer approach (see Methods). Then, using the same PAC method as used on the sensor-level analyses described above [@tort_measuring_2010; @tort_thetagamma_2009], we computed PAC estimates for each trial and each source-space point (whole brain) and then fit the trial-wise PAC estimates to the model generated by our simulation (i.e. decreasing PAC estimates across a 6-item sequence). Thus, this analysis was nearly identical to the sensor-level analysis, but performed on source-space time-series estimates throughout the whole brain. Remarkably, the only region to reliably emerge from this analysis was a region of the medial temporal lobe centered in the left hippocampus (Figure 3.1e, _t_ > 3.19, _p_ < .005; see Figure 3.8 for other thresholds), extending posteriorly to a region of the parahippocampal gyrus bordering on the fusiform gyrus. This result is consistent with the suspected role of the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe cortical regions in sequence encoding [@dubrow_temporal_2014; @hsieh_hippocampal_2014; @jenkins_prefrontal_2010; @tubridy_medial_2011] and is consistent with the idea that sequence memory may be supported by an interaction between theta and gamma band activity in the left hippocampus.

### Theta phase coding supports temporal sequence encoding

While the sensor-level and source-space analyses described above establish that theta-gamma PAC is modulated by position within a sequence in a manner that is consistent with the idea that gamma-coded objects are represented sequentially along the phase of theta, they do not directly demonstrate that result. Indeed, one could imagine alternative scenarios where the decreasing theta-gamma PAC pattern across sequence positions could emerge - a simple example being that the response pattern represents accumulating item representations without the orderly representation of their temporal order.

Thus, we conducted additional analyses to directly test our central hypothesis that objects encountered in different positions within a sequence are coded at distinct and consecutive phases of theta. To that end, we first extracted raw MEG data from the two clusters of sensors that displayed a significant fit to the model derived from our simulated data (Figure 3.1d).  Separately for these two clusters of sensors, we binned gamma power by the phase of theta (18 phase bins) to generate an individual histogram for each trial (during stimulus presentation: 0-2.5 seconds; see Methods for details). We then averaged the theta-binned gamma distributions for each cluster across all subjects, but separately for trials in distinct sequence positions and also separately by subsequent temporal order memory, as we reasoned that phase coding may be present or robust only during successful sequence encoding.

Examining successfully encoded sequences first, in the left posterior cluster of sensors we find a main effect of position on the distribution of gamma power over theta phase (Watson-Williams Test: _F_(5,96) = 16.04, _p_ < .0001)  and, critically, the gamma power distributions reflected the relative order in which the objects were encoded (Figure 3.2a; Figure 3.9).  By contrast, for sequences where order memory was later incorrect, we observed significant differences in mean phase angle by position (Watson-Williams Test: _F_(5,96) = 5.26, _p_ < .0001), but the order of the phase angles was scrambled relative to the actual order that the items were experienced (Figure 3.2b).  Critically, the memory by position interaction was also significant (Harrison-Kanji Test: _F_(5,196) = 15.79, _p_ = .01).  Together, these results suggest that objects in distinct ordinal positions within a sequence may be coded in gamma band activity biased towards distinct, and ordered, phases of a theta oscillation.

Another way to visualize this effect is to plot the relative phase biases in polar coordinates.  Thus, we transformed the theta-binned gamma distributions into polar coordinates, now plotting the mean phase angle of theta-gamma coupling for each sequence position separately for sequences where order was later remembered and when they were forgotten, after removing the main effect of coupling, which was centered at the trough of theta.  We see that, for sequences whose temporal order was later remembered, the order of the angles across sequence positions reflected the order in which the objects were encoded (Figure 3.2c), whereas for incorrect sequences, the order of the angles is scrambled relative to the actual encoding order (Figure 3.2d).

In the next analysis, we averaged the theta-binned gamma distributions for the 6-sequence positions into 3 bins (1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6) after subtracting out the main effect of coupling.  A statistical contrast of each position bin relative to the average of the other two bins shows that gamma power was preferentially higher at distinct phase bins of theta (Figure 3.2c; _t_’s >  2.1, _p_’s < .05).  However, for sequences where the temporal order was later incorrectly remembered, the relative distributions for each position bin were comparatively flat, and there were no single phase bins where the position bins were significantly different from each other (_t_’s < 2.1, _p_’s > .05). Together, these data are consistent with the idea that successful sequence encoding is accompanied by a theta-gamma phase coding mechanism, whereby gamma power associated with each sequential item is biased toward a distinct, consecutive phase of an underlying theta oscillation.

### Ruling out alternative explanations

While the results reported here are consistent with a theta phase coding account of sequence memory formation, it is important to rule out alternative explanations for the data.  Below, we outline a number of control analyses aimed to test whether other features of the data could explain the effects.

*Temporal dynamics of gamma power and theta phase locking.* We considered the possibility that variance in gamma power or theta phase locking across sequence positions or memory conditions could explain the phase coding effects.  To test this, we analyzed the time course of gamma power and theta phase locking separately by sequence position (binned 1 & 2, 3 & 4 and 5 & 6) and by subsequent memory in the left posterior cluster of interest that displayed phase coding.  As can be seen in Figure 3.10 & 3.11, transient stimulus-evoked gamma power and theta phase locking stabilize by 500 ms post stimulus onset.  There were no differences in theta phase locking by position (0-500 ms: _F_(2,34) = .78, _p_ = .46, 500-2500 ms: _F_(2,34) = .5, _p_ = .61] and no differences by subsequent memory [0-500 ms: _F_(1,34) = 1.17, _p_ = .29; 500-2500 ms: _F_(1,34) = .04, _p_ = .96]. Gamma power also did not significantly vary by sequence position (0-500 ms: _F_(2,34) = .24, _p_ = .78; 500-2500ms: _F_(2,34) = .13, _p_ = .87) and there was a trend for greater gamma power in the forgotten sequences compared to the remembered sequences early (0-500 ms) but not later (500-2500 ms) (0-500 ms: _F_(1,34) = 3.12, _p_ = .09; 500-2500 ms: _F_(1,34) = .95, _p_ = .34).  It’s important to highlight that absolute gamma power likely did not play a role in the phase coding effects we see here, because for each trial, after computing the distribution of gamma power over theta phase, the resulting distribution was normalized (to sum to 1).  This minimizes the likelihood that the phase coding effects were somehow driven by gamma power differences across conditions.

*Removing the stimulus evoked response.* One major concern when performing cross-frequency coupling analyses is that the neural response to the presentation of a stimulus could simultaneously result in a burst of high-frequency activity and low frequency phase alignment over trials.  Thus, an effect that looks like a phase-amplitude interaction may actually be driven by two independent processes with a common driver.  It is worth noting that a burst of high-frequency activity at stimulus onset would need also be accompanied by (1) a predictable shift in theta phase across each position in a sequence and (2) only do so on successfully encoded sequences to fully account for our results.  Nonetheless, to rule out the possibility that our effects are in some way driven by an evoked stimulus response, we reanalyzed the data without the time window containing the evoked potential.

We then recomputed our phase coding analyses removing the first 500 milliseconds from each trial, which effectively removed the stimulus onset response from the analysis.  We found that both the decreasing PAC over event positions (Figure 3.12; including first 500ms: _t_(16) = 6.9868, _p_ = 3.0663e-06, excluding first 500ms: _t_(16) = 6.1015, _p_ = 1.5301e-05), as well as the phase coding by subsequent order memory effects (Figure 3.13; excluding first 500ms - temporal order correct: Watson William’s Test _F_(5,96) = 9.10, _p_ < .0001; temporal order incorrect: Watson William’s Test _F_(5,96) = 6.42, _p_ < .001; memory by sequence position interaction: Harrison-Kanji Test: _F_(5,196) = 11.03, _p_ = .025) were still present and statistically robust.

*Phase coding in the inter-trial interval.* As a further test to rule out an evoked response confound, we ran these same analyses on the time periods between each trial, the inter-trial intervals (ITI; 2500-5000 ms post stimulus onset), when participants were presumably maintaining prior items and reinforcing associations between items. Interestingly, we found that theta-gamma PAC was in fact stronger during the ITI than the stimulus presentation interval (see Figure 3.14a) and the phase coding by subsequent memory effects were still present and robust (temporal order correct: Watson William’s Test _F_(5,96) = 9.10, _p_ < .0001; temporal order incorrect: Watson William’s Test _F_(5,96) = 9.09, _p_ < .0001; position x memory interaction: Harrison-Kanji Test: _F_(5,196) = 8.02, _p_ = .07).  However, the decreasing PAC by sequence position effect was no longer present (Figure 3.14b).  This very intriguing result highlights that phase coding is persistent even after the stimulus was removed from the screen, thus ruling out the possibility that the evoked response is in someway responsible for the phase coding pattern we observed.

*Testing for systematic shifts in theta phase by sequence position.* Another possible alternative explanation for our result is that gamma power remains temporally fixed with respect to the onset of the stimulus, but there is a systematic shift in theta phase as a function of sequence positions, perhaps due to a reset in the phase of theta caused by the stimulus presentation.  To test for a mechanism of this nature, we simulated sinusoidal time series at the theta frequency, where the phase of theta systematically shifted over the sequence, and then computed the cross-correlation of the simulated time series for each pair of sequence positions (cross-correlation between 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, etc.).  If a systematic theta phase shift is present in the data, then the peak cross-correlation should also systematically increase with increasing lag between items.  An analysis of this ‘toy’ example concretized our intuition that the temporal lag of the peak correlation would increase with distance between sequence positions (Figure 3.15).  We used this framework to test for a systematic phase shift in our data at the level of each sequence, and then averaging the peak lag values over sequences and over subjects.  We performed this analysis specifically for correct sequence, as that is where we observed the phase coding effects.  The results do not reveal any evidence for a systematic theta phase shift across sequences (_F_(4,84) = .33, _p_ > .5; Figure 3.15).  Thus, the phase-amplitude relationship is more likely to be driven by a shift in gamma across sequence positions rather than a phase shift in theta.

*Testing for systematic changes in theta phase symmetry.* Finally, another possible explanation for PAC modulation by sequence position is that the shape of the theta waveform could systematically change, becoming more or less asymmetric over a sequence of items.  While the exact pattern of expected results would vary based on the phase dynamics, oscillations with symmetric, sinusoidal phase dynamics will map to a circular distribution in polar coordinates, while asymmetric oscillations will map to a non-circular distribution (see Figure 3.16 for a visualization of this pattern).  To test whether an interaction between phase symmetry and sequence position could explain these effects, we filtered each trial in the theta band.  Then, we computed group-averaged phase-amplitude distributions in polar coordinates, averaging separately over each sequence position. The results suggest that the theta waveforms were equally symmetric over sequence positions (Watson-Williams test: _F_(5,101) = .23, _p_ = .94), but varied in power, which is evident by increasing area of the polar phase distributions by sequence position (Figure 3.13). This replicates the prior finding that theta power systematically increases over sequence positions.  Thus, differences in phase symmetry are not likely to explain this pattern of results.

# Discussion

Temporal coding models [@harris_neural_2005] converge on the idea that the brain may utilize the precise timing of neuronal firing to encode information.  Theta phase coding models [@lisman_storage_1995; @lisman_-_2013; @lisman_neural_2008; @hasselmo_proposed_2002; @huxter_independent_2003; @tsodyks_population_1996; @dragoi_temporal_2006] of sequence encoding specifically predict that the order in which a sequence of events occurred in the external world may be represented internally in the brain in the timing of neuronal firing (in the gamma frequency) with respect to the phase of an underlying theta wave.  Our results provide compelling evidence in humans that a bias in gamma power along the phase of an underlying theta rhythm is apparent during successful, but not unsuccessful, sequence encoding.  These findings suggest that by associating the ordinal position of a gamma-coded item representation with a particular theta phase, the brain may preserve the order in which a sequence occurred.

In this study, we assessed whether gamma power during the encoding of items in distinct sequence positions was preferentially bias towards distinct and consecutive phases of theta. Critically, using this paradigm, we were able to separately examine whether phase coding was evident during both successful and unsuccessful temporal order encoding   First, consistent with prior research [@canolty_high_2006; @jacobs_neural_2009; @voytek_shifts_2010] (but see @axmacher_cross-frequency_2010) we found that for all items (regardless of sequence position), gamma power was maximal at the trough of the theta cycle.  Secondly – and in line with our primary predictions – during sequence encoding, gamma power was shifted progressively later in the theta cycle for each item in the sequence, and the relative peak gamma power reflected the order in which the items were encountered (Figure 3.2 & 3.3).  Critically, this ordinal phase coding effect was only present during sequences participants were later able to correctly remembered the temporal order of items encountered in that sequence. The specificity of this effect to successfully encoded sequences provides strong support for the notion that the brain may code for recent elements in memory by leveraging relative phase differences among distinct items in a sequence.  The specificity to remembered sequences also helps to rule out that the effects are somehow derivative only of the visual and task structure, as the timing of stimulus onset and task motor responses are the same for trials within sequences where temporal order was later forgotten and when they were remembered. Further supporting this point, the memory-related phase coding effects were present after removing the early trial activity (<500ms, during evoked response), and remarkably, even persisted into the inter-trial interval (when the stimulus is no longer on the screen).  These results provide evidence for a longstanding theory that theta-gamma phase coding might support temporal sequence memory [@lisman_-_2013].

In our initial set of analyses, we found that theta-gamma PAC was modulated by the position of the object within a sequence. Specifically, using a computational model-driven linear regression approach (see Methods), we found that our measure of theta-gamma PAC decreased over items in a sequence, and this effect was present in left lateralized and left posterior MEG sensors (Figure 3.1d).  While perhaps counterintuitive, this decreasing pattern of our PAC measure is predicted by a computational simulation of our hypothesis (Figure 3.1c) and is driven by a broadening of the gamma distribution over a theta cycle (see Figure 3.2).  Then, using an adaptive beamforming technique, the source of this effect was localized to the left hippocampus, extending into the left parahippocampal and adjacent fusiform gyri (Figure 3.1e), consistent with the suspected role of the left hippocampus and medial temporal lobe cortex in temporal sequence encoding [@dubrow_temporal_2014; @hsieh_hippocampal_2014; @jenkins_prefrontal_2010; @tubridy_medial_2011].

One remaining question is: what is the nature of the mechanism that is driving the model fits in our initial set of analyses (i.e. Figure 3.1d)?  One possibility is that the broadening of gamma power across sequential positions is the result of the accrual and maintenance of all prior items within a sequence, each nested in a distinct phase of an underlying theta oscillation, similar to the model proposed by @lisman_storage_1995 and formalized in our computational simulation (see Figure 3.1b & c).  It follows then that the representation of additional items would result in a broader distribution of gamma power over a theta cycle.  
A second possibility, however, is that the effect is driven by a progressive shift in gamma power along the phase of theta while items are being encoded (in the absence of gamma broadening related to the accrual of item representations). On its own, this pattern would not modulate theta-gamma coupling as we measured it.  This is because the measure of coupling we used is sensitive to the width of the gamma distribution over theta, and a mere shift in gamma power would not modulate the width of the distribution.  However, a forward shift in gamma power by sequence position -- in conjunction with the strong main effect of coupling we observed in the data – could, in fact, account for the pattern of decreasing PAC by sequence position that we observed.  For instance, if items in early sequence positions were preferentially locked to the trough of theta (i.e. where gamma power is highest for all sequence positions in our data), this pattern would result in an exaggerated measure of theta-gamma coupling for early positions.  If items later in a sequence were preferentially coded at the theta power peak (i.e. where gamma is lowest for all sequence positions), this would result in an attenuated measure of theta gamma coupling.  While a subtle (but very important) point, our initial analyses were actually agnostic to the relative likelihood of either of these two possibilities.

Our data are more consistent with the latter model where a position-related forward shift in gamma power along the phase of theta supports sequence memory encoding, in the absence of accruing gamma-coded item representations.  There are two major data points that led us to this conclusion.  First, if additional items are being added into the sequence representation, one might expect overall measures of gamma power to increase across the sequence as well.  Contrary to this expectation, gamma power was relatively flat across the sequence (Figure 3.6).  Secondly, one might also expect, that the width of the gamma power distribution over theta should broaden as a function of sequence position (as more item representations are accrued and maintained).  Contrary to this hypothesis, we did not see evidence that the width (standard deviation) of the distribution increased across sequence positions (_F_(1,15) = .20, _p_ > .5). Thus, we believe that the best explanation for our results is that sequence encoding is supported by a temporal shifting of gamma power (representing each item) along the phase of an underlying theta oscillation.

With this conclusion in mind, it is important to point out that in order to examine gamma power associated with each sequential position, we had to examine a time window that was actually associated with each item presentation – i.e. the time period when that stimulus was presented, as well as the immediately following inter-trial interval.  In its original conception, the Lisman and Idiart model was proposed as a mechanism to support the maintenance of multi-item sequences in working memory - after items had been encountered and were presumably being actively maintained.  We reasoned if gamma power associated with each item representation in a sequence is ordered along an underlying theta wave, we should be able to measure this effect while these items are being encoded.  Thus, the current results do not preclude the possibility that, during working memory, if one could track the gamma power associated with each item into subsequent time periods, that they would still be associated with the same phase of theta.

Furthermore, the maintenance of multiple items is likely to be dependent on the task and specifically whether items are being ‘actively’ retained in working memory. Our task is not necessarily an  ‘active’ working memory task in the sense that participants are not required to rehearse and maintain the sequence of items during a delay period as in classical working memory paradigms.  Rather, participants are instructed to remember the temporal order of the sequence by forming associative links between neighboring items, which likely involves some working memory maintenance along with other associative encoding operations.  Thus, our current results are agnostic as to whether one would see the continued maintenance of phase coding effects during working memory rehearsal. Thus, it is important to point out that this data is not necessarily in conflict with the Lisman and Idiart model, and may in fact be parsimonious.  Future studies should test whether there is a relationship between theta-gamma phase coding during sequence memory encoding and theta/gamma activity that has been observed during working memory maintenance [@axmacher_cross-frequency_2010].

The gamma power effects we report here peaked between ~70-100 Hz.  Critically, recent work using simultaneous MEG/iEEG suggests that gamma power <100 Hz is reliably detectable [@dalal_simultaneous_2013].  Interestingly, recent work in rodents suggests that there is a functional distinction between high (~60-100 Hz) and low (25-55 Hz) gamma in the hippocampal circuit, such that lower frequency theta-locked gamma ‘sweeps’ may represent the future spatiotemporal trajectory of the animal, while fast theta-locked gamma may support the coding of ongoing trajectories in real-time [@zheng_spatial_2016].  Possibly related to this dissociation, in the current study, where subjects were encoding trial-unique sequences (i.e. sequences did not repeat, and thus could not be ‘predicted’), we observed our memory-related phase coding effects in high gamma.  Future work could test whether a theta phase – low gamma power relationship emerges with repeated sequences, possibly indexing the forward prediction of upcoming items.  While its important to note that our experimental design as well as the signals that we are recording are admittedly very different than the rodent study discussed above, it is nonetheless intriguing to consider parallels between the datasets.

While gamma power was relatively stable over positions, we observed an increase in theta power across the sequence.  This is consistent with studies that show theta power increases during memory encoding [@summerfield_coherent_2005; @sederberg_theta_2003] and working memory maintenance [@hsieh_neural_2011; @gevins_high-resolution_1997; @raghavachari_gating_2001; @scheeringa_trial-by-trial_2009].  A prior study observed theta power increases specifically during delay period maintenance of temporal order information as compared to the maintenance of just the items themselves [@hsieh_neural_2011].  One possibility is that theta power increases reflect control processes related to relational encoding [@hsieh_neural_2011; @summerfield_coherent_2005].  Consistent with this idea, we see that sustained theta power increases occur predominantly over frontal regions (see Figure 3.4), possibly reflecting prefrontal control processes involved in representing temporal relations among items [@blumenfeld_putting_2011].

There is a rapidly growing literature linking theta-gamma coupling to human memory [@canolty_high_2006; @axmacher_cross-frequency_2010; @mormann_phase/amplitude_2005; @fuentemilla_theta-coupled_2010; @maris_spatially_2011; @friese_successful_2013; @lisman_-_2013] , and to cognition more generally.  These memory studies all converge on the idea that theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling plays a role in the maintenance, as well as the long-term retention of mnemonic information. While these prior studies have been critical to advancing our understanding of the temporal dynamics of episodic memory formation, the fundamental and important question of whether theta phase coding supports sequence encoding has not been tested.  To our knowledge, these data provide the first empirical evidence in humans that memory for sequences of information is supported by the precise timing of item-related gamma activity with respect to an underlying theta oscillation.

Prior work in rodents has leveraged the spatial specificity of ‘place cells’ [@okeefe_hippocampus_1971; @okeefe_review_1979] to show that sequences of hippocampal place cells representing a ‘movement trajectory’ not only fire during an experience, but also later ‘replay’ in a similar order on subsequent cycles of a theta oscillation [@gupta_segmentation_2012; @johnson_neural_2007; @wikenheiser_hippocampal_2015; @foster_hippocampal_2007; @pastalkova_internally_2008; @dragoi_temporal_2006].   The current result, by analogy, demonstrates that the encoding of an episodic ‘object trajectory’ or temporal sequence of items is also supported by a theta phase code.  Given these two sets of findings, it is possible that the sequential coding of information along the phase of a theta oscillation represents an all-purpose mechanism in the brain that allows for temporally or spatially separated information to be associated via long-term potentiation. In summary, these results fill a critical gap in the literature by providing new empirical evidence from a well-controlled and characterized behavioral paradigm in humans that theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling and more specifically, theta phase coding, supports object sequence memory.

  \caption[Testing for systematic theta phase shift by sequence position.]{\textit{Testing for systematic theta phase shift by sequence position.} The top row is simulated data in the theta frequency for each sequence position, where we simulated a systematic linear phase shift over the sequence.  The bottom row is the group-averaged data after computing each of these metrics within-subject.  The left column is the data filtered in the theta band. The right row is the lag of the peak in the pair-wise cross-correlation.  If a systematic phase shift was present in the data, we would expect a monotonically increasing lag as a function of sequence position.}

  \caption[Theta phase symmetry]{\textit{Theta (3-8 Hz) is symmetric and symmetry doesn’t vary by sequence position.} (A) On the left is a simulated 4 Hz sine wave.  Plotted in the middle is the phase time series of the theta wave.  On the right, the waveform is plotted in polar coordinates, where the circular angle represents the phase and the distance from the center represents the power. (B) The same plot as listed above, but for a square wave at 4 Hz. (C) Polar plot representing the grand average of the MEG time series during stimulus presentation (0 to 2.5s) filtered in the theta range (3-8 Hz) and averaged over the left posterior cluster of sensors.  Each color represents a distinct sequence position.}
